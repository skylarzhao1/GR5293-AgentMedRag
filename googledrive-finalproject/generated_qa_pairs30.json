    "abstract": "Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a cutting-edge strategy for combating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Unlike conventional antibiotics, SDT leverages the generation of reactive oxygen species during the treatment process to inflict multifaceted damage on bacterial cells, thereby significantly reducing the likelihood of developing drug resistance. Compared to other physical sterilisation methods, such as ultraviolet irradiation, SDT offers enhanced tissue penetration, making it particularly suitable for addressing deep-seated infections, including osteomyelitis. Despite its significant advantages, the clinical translation of SDT for antibacterial applications faces several challenges. This review discusses the fundamental mechanisms of SDT, with a focus on phenomena such as cavitation-induced reactions and piezocatalytic generation of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive analysis of various sonosensitisers used in SDT, emphasising their potential to enhance therapeutic outcomes in areas such as infected wound healing, bone regeneration, and the mitigation of deep tissue inflammation. While SDT shows great promise in addressing multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, further research and development are essential to overcome existing limitations and unlock its full clinical potential.",

    "abstract": "The protein heterodimer calprotectin and its component proteins, S100A8 and S100A9, play important antibacterial and pro-inflammatory roles in the mammalian innate immune response. Gaining mechanistic insights into the regulation and biological function of calprotectin will help facilitate patient diagnostics and therapy for inflammation and further our understanding of the host-microbe interface. Recent literature has identified zebrafish s100a10b as zebrafish calprotectin based on sequence similarity, genomic context, and transcriptional upregulation during the immune response to bacterial infections. The field would benefit from expanding the breadth of calprotectin studies into a zebrafish innate immunity model. Here, we carefully evaluated the possibility that zebrafish possess a calprotectin ortholog or a paralog that convergently evolved similar function. Using careful bioinformatics approaches, we found that zebrafish do not have an ortholog of either mammalian S100A8 or S100A9. To look for paralogs with convergent function, we identified four zebrafish s100 proteins-including s100a10b-that are expressed in immune cells and upregulated during the immune response. We recombinantly expressed and purified these proteins and measured their antimicrobial activity. None of the zebrafish proteins exhibited activity comparable to mammalian calprotectin. We also generated structural models of all homodimers and heterodimers of all annotated zebrafish s100 genes. None of these complexes were predicted to have an antimicrobial transition metal binding site equivalent to calprotectin. Finally, we measured the ability of our four purified zebrafish s100 proteins to activate inflammation via Toll-like receptor 4, a key feature of human S100A9; none of the proteins activated the receptor. Our work demonstrates conclusively that zebrafish have no ortholog of calprotectin and suggests that similar proteins have not convergently evolved analogous functions.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability worldwide, with ischemic stroke (IS) accounting for the vast majority of cases. This paper reviews the latest research on intestinal damage, changes in the gut microbiota, and related therapeutic strategies after IS. Following IS, the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier is compromised, leading to increased intestinal permeability. The gut microbiota can translocate to other organs, triggering systemic immune responses that inhibit recovery after IS. Moreover, the composition and proportion of the gut microbiota change after IS. The number of beneficial bacteria decreases, whereas the number of harmful bacteria increases. The production of beneficial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), is reduced, and the levels of harmful metabolites, such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), increase. Antibiotics after IS not only help prevent infection but also have neuroprotective effects. Although poststroke reperfusion therapy can effectively restore cerebral blood flow, it may also cause intestinal mucosal damage and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Nutritional support after IS can alter the gut microbiota structure and promote neurological recovery. Therefore, individualized treatment for IS patients is crucial. In summary, IS affects not only the brain but the entire body system, especially the gut. Intestinal damage and dysbiosis are critical in IS occurrence, development, and prognosis. By protecting the intestinal mucosa and modulating the structure of the gut microbiota, intestinal damage and related infections can be reduced, improving patient prognosis. Future research is needed to explore therapeutic methods targeting the gut microbiota, providing more comprehensive and effective treatment strategies for IS patients.",

    "abstract": "Chloroplast transformation technology has become a powerful platform for generating plants that express foreign proteins of pharmaceutical and agricultural importance at high levels. Chloroplasts are often chosen as attractive targets for the introduction of new agronomic traits because they have their own genome and protein synthesis machinery. Certain valuable traits have been genetically engineered into plastid genomes to improve crop yield, nutritional quality, resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses, and the production of industrial enzymes and therapeutic proteins. Synthetic biology approaches aim to play an important role in expressing multiple genes through plastid engineering, without the risk of pleiotropic effects in transplastomic plants. Despite many promising laboratory-level successes, no transplastomic crop has been commercialized to date. This technology is mostly confined to model species in academic laboratories and needs to be expanded to other agronomically important crop species to capitalize on its significant commercial potential. However, in recent years, some transplastomic lines are progressing in field trials, offering hope that they will pass regulatory approval and enter the marketplace. This review provides a comprehensive summary of new and emerging technologies employed for plastid transformation and discusses key synthetic biology elements that are necessary for the construction of modern transformation vectors. It also focuses on various novel insights and challenges to overcome in chloroplast transformation.",
    "question": "What are some of the potential applications of chloroplast transformation technology in plants?",
    "answer": "Answer:\nSome potential applications of chloroplast transformation technology in plants include improving crop yield, enhancing nutritional quality, increasing resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses, and producing industrial enzymes and therapeutic proteins."

    "abstract": "The placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) was previously called the morbidly adherent placenta. It involves a range of pathological adherence of the placenta, including placenta increta, placenta percreta and placenta accreta, depending on the depth of invasion of anchoring villi into the myometrium and beyond. This spectrum of disorder is becoming a frequently encountered problem as a consequence of rising caesarean rates all over the world. Hysterectomy during caesarean delivery (CD) has been the conventional management of PAS. However, associated complications have prompted conservative surgery at the first sitting, with or without interventional radiology. The aim is to reduce blood loss and conserve the uterus if possible. It was decided to review the available literature on this emerging topic. Using PubMed and Google Scholar, our search focused on articles published from 2004 onwards, utilizing search terms \"Placenta Accreta Spectrum\" OR \"Adherent Placenta\" and \"Caesarean Delivery\". The selection for review adhered to specified inclusion/exclusion criteria and finally focused on 50 articles. It was found that published work includes the following conservative approaches: first, to leave the placenta expecting autolysis and resolution; second, to leave the placenta with the intention of a delayed hysterectomy; and third, to resort to an intraoperative arterial occlusion and follow-up. Though the primary objective of reducing blood loss at initial surgery is usually achieved, the success of uterine preservation differs. The availability of a multidisciplinary team for the surgical management of PAS is an important factor to consider. Limiting the extent of surgery at the time of CD, combined with or without arterial embolization/ballooning/ligation, reduces blood loss and limits morbidity with the potential to preserve the uterus.",

    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of hematologic cancer characterized by the uncontrolled clonal expansion of plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). This leads to significant dysfunction and suppression of the immune system in affected patients. Myeloma cells employ sophisticated strategies to manipulate immune and non-immune cells, evading immune surveillance and enhancing their survival. One key factor in this evasion is the disruption of dendritic cell (DC)-mediated immune mechanisms. Extensive evidence indicates that in the presence of myeloma cells, DC numbers are notably reduced, and their phenotype and function are altered, impairing their ability to present antigens and activate robust T-cell responses effectively. Despite rapid advances in MM treatment, with promising strategies such as DC-based vaccines being already achieved, DC dysfunction remains a substantial hurdle, associated with or contributing to poor therapeutic outcomes, disease relapse, and MM's persistence as an incurable disease. To address these challenges, it is essential to understand the intricate mechanisms through which myeloma cells transform DCs into their \"accomplices,\" undermining immune responses. This review comprehensively summarizes the current understanding of the role of DCs in MM. Additionally, it evaluates the potential of DCs in anti-MM immunotherapy, discussing persistent challenges and highlighting emerging perspectives that may lead to promising breakthroughs for improved patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction is one of the most prevalent diseases in otorhinolaryngology, particularly since the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with a potential impact on daily life. Several etiological factors can contribute to olfactory dysfunction owing to the complexity and specificity of the olfactory transmission pathway. However, current treatments for olfactory dysfunction are limited and their efficacy is unsatisfactory. Olfactory stem cells are multifunctional stem cells in the olfactory mucosa that comprise both horizontal and global basal stem cells (HBCs and GBCs, respectively). These cells can differentiate into various cell types in response to different stimuli with distinct characteristics. The aim of the study was to discuss the mechanisms and functions of stem cells and their application in the treatment of olfactory dysfunction.",
