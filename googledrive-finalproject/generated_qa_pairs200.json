    "abstract": "Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a cutting-edge strategy for combating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Unlike conventional antibiotics, SDT leverages the generation of reactive oxygen species during the treatment process to inflict multifaceted damage on bacterial cells, thereby significantly reducing the likelihood of developing drug resistance. Compared to other physical sterilisation methods, such as ultraviolet irradiation, SDT offers enhanced tissue penetration, making it particularly suitable for addressing deep-seated infections, including osteomyelitis. Despite its significant advantages, the clinical translation of SDT for antibacterial applications faces several challenges. This review discusses the fundamental mechanisms of SDT, with a focus on phenomena such as cavitation-induced reactions and piezocatalytic generation of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive analysis of various sonosensitisers used in SDT, emphasising their potential to enhance therapeutic outcomes in areas such as infected wound healing, bone regeneration, and the mitigation of deep tissue inflammation. While SDT shows great promise in addressing multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, further research and development are essential to overcome existing limitations and unlock its full clinical potential.",

    "abstract": "The protein heterodimer calprotectin and its component proteins, S100A8 and S100A9, play important antibacterial and pro-inflammatory roles in the mammalian innate immune response. Gaining mechanistic insights into the regulation and biological function of calprotectin will help facilitate patient diagnostics and therapy for inflammation and further our understanding of the host-microbe interface. Recent literature has identified zebrafish s100a10b as zebrafish calprotectin based on sequence similarity, genomic context, and transcriptional upregulation during the immune response to bacterial infections. The field would benefit from expanding the breadth of calprotectin studies into a zebrafish innate immunity model. Here, we carefully evaluated the possibility that zebrafish possess a calprotectin ortholog or a paralog that convergently evolved similar function. Using careful bioinformatics approaches, we found that zebrafish do not have an ortholog of either mammalian S100A8 or S100A9. To look for paralogs with convergent function, we identified four zebrafish s100 proteins-including s100a10b-that are expressed in immune cells and upregulated during the immune response. We recombinantly expressed and purified these proteins and measured their antimicrobial activity. None of the zebrafish proteins exhibited activity comparable to mammalian calprotectin. We also generated structural models of all homodimers and heterodimers of all annotated zebrafish s100 genes. None of these complexes were predicted to have an antimicrobial transition metal binding site equivalent to calprotectin. Finally, we measured the ability of our four purified zebrafish s100 proteins to activate inflammation via Toll-like receptor 4, a key feature of human S100A9; none of the proteins activated the receptor. Our work demonstrates conclusively that zebrafish have no ortholog of calprotectin and suggests that similar proteins have not convergently evolved analogous functions.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability worldwide, with ischemic stroke (IS) accounting for the vast majority of cases. This paper reviews the latest research on intestinal damage, changes in the gut microbiota, and related therapeutic strategies after IS. Following IS, the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier is compromised, leading to increased intestinal permeability. The gut microbiota can translocate to other organs, triggering systemic immune responses that inhibit recovery after IS. Moreover, the composition and proportion of the gut microbiota change after IS. The number of beneficial bacteria decreases, whereas the number of harmful bacteria increases. The production of beneficial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), is reduced, and the levels of harmful metabolites, such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), increase. Antibiotics after IS not only help prevent infection but also have neuroprotective effects. Although poststroke reperfusion therapy can effectively restore cerebral blood flow, it may also cause intestinal mucosal damage and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Nutritional support after IS can alter the gut microbiota structure and promote neurological recovery. Therefore, individualized treatment for IS patients is crucial. In summary, IS affects not only the brain but the entire body system, especially the gut. Intestinal damage and dysbiosis are critical in IS occurrence, development, and prognosis. By protecting the intestinal mucosa and modulating the structure of the gut microbiota, intestinal damage and related infections can be reduced, improving patient prognosis. Future research is needed to explore therapeutic methods targeting the gut microbiota, providing more comprehensive and effective treatment strategies for IS patients.",
    "question": "How does ischemic stroke affect the gut microbiota and intestinal mucosal barrier, and what potential therapeutic strategies can be used to improve patient prognosis?",
    "answer": "Answer:\nIschemic stroke leads to changes in the gut microbiota, with a decrease in beneficial bacteria and an increase in harmful bacteria. This imbalance is associated with increased intestinal permeability and translocation of gut microbiota to other organs, triggering systemic immune responses that inhibit recovery after stroke. Therapeutic strategies such as antibiotics, nutritional support, and individualized treatment targeting the gut microbiota and intestinal mucosa can help reduce intestinal damage and related infections, ultimately improving patient prognosis."

    "abstract": "Chloroplast transformation technology has become a powerful platform for generating plants that express foreign proteins of pharmaceutical and agricultural importance at high levels. Chloroplasts are often chosen as attractive targets for the introduction of new agronomic traits because they have their own genome and protein synthesis machinery. Certain valuable traits have been genetically engineered into plastid genomes to improve crop yield, nutritional quality, resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses, and the production of industrial enzymes and therapeutic proteins. Synthetic biology approaches aim to play an important role in expressing multiple genes through plastid engineering, without the risk of pleiotropic effects in transplastomic plants. Despite many promising laboratory-level successes, no transplastomic crop has been commercialized to date. This technology is mostly confined to model species in academic laboratories and needs to be expanded to other agronomically important crop species to capitalize on its significant commercial potential. However, in recent years, some transplastomic lines are progressing in field trials, offering hope that they will pass regulatory approval and enter the marketplace. This review provides a comprehensive summary of new and emerging technologies employed for plastid transformation and discusses key synthetic biology elements that are necessary for the construction of modern transformation vectors.

    "abstract": "The placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) was previously called the morbidly adherent placenta. It involves a range of pathological adherence of the placenta, including placenta increta, placenta percreta and placenta accreta, depending on the depth of invasion of anchoring villi into the myometrium and beyond. This spectrum of disorder is becoming a frequently encountered problem as a consequence of rising caesarean rates all over the world. Hysterectomy during caesarean delivery (CD) has been the conventional management of PAS. However, associated complications have prompted conservative surgery at the first sitting, with or without interventional radiology. The aim is to reduce blood loss and conserve the uterus if possible. It was decided to review the available literature on this emerging topic. Using PubMed and Google Scholar, our search focused on articles published from 2004 onwards, utilizing search terms \"Placenta Accreta Spectrum\" OR \"Adherent Placenta\" and \"Caesarean Delivery\". The selection for review adhered to specified inclusion/exclusion criteria and finally focused on 50 articles. It was found that published work includes the following conservative approaches: first, to leave the placenta expecting autolysis and resolution; second, to leave the placenta with the intention of a delayed hysterectomy; and third, to resort to an intraoperative arterial occlusion and follow-up. Though the primary objective of reducing blood loss at initial surgery is usually achieved, the success of uterine preservation differs. The availability of a multidisciplinary team for the surgical management of PAS is an important factor to consider. Limiting the extent of surgery at the time of CD, combined with or without arterial embolization/ballooning/ligation, reduces blood loss and limits morbidity with the potential to preserve the uterus.",

    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of hematologic cancer characterized by the uncontrolled clonal expansion of plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). This leads to significant dysfunction and suppression of the immune system in affected patients. Myeloma cells employ sophisticated strategies to manipulate immune and non-immune cells, evading immune surveillance and enhancing their survival. One key factor in this evasion is the disruption of dendritic cell (DC)-mediated immune mechanisms. Extensive evidence indicates that in the presence of myeloma cells, DC numbers are notably reduced, and their phenotype and function are altered, impairing their ability to present antigens and activate robust T-cell responses effectively. Despite rapid advances in MM treatment, with promising strategies such as DC-based vaccines being already achieved, DC dysfunction remains a substantial hurdle, associated with or contributing to poor therapeutic outcomes, disease relapse, and MM's persistence as an incurable disease. To address these challenges, it is essential to understand the intricate mechanisms through which myeloma cells transform DCs into their \"accomplices,\" undermining immune responses. This review comprehensively summarizes the current understanding of the role of DCs in MM. Additionally, it evaluates the potential of DCs in anti-MM immunotherapy, discussing persistent challenges and highlighting emerging perspectives that may lead to promising breakthroughs for improved patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) act as crucial regulators of gene expression within cells, exerting precise control over processes such as RNA splicing, transport, localization, stability, and translation through their specific binding to RNA molecules. The diversity and complexity of RBPs are particularly significant in cancer biology, as they directly impact a multitude of RNA metabolic events closely associated with tumor initiation and progression. The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), as a member of the RBP family, is central to the neurodevelopmental disorder fragile X syndrome and increasingly recognized in the modulation of cancer biology through its influence on RNA metabolism. The protein's versatility, stemming from its diverse RNA-binding domains, enables it to govern a wide array of transcript processing events. Modifications in FMRP's expression or localization have been associated with the regulation of mRNAs linked to various processes pertinent to cancer, including tumor proliferation, metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cellular senescence, chemotherapy/radiotherapy resistance, and immunotherapy evasion. In this review, we emphasize recent findings and analyses that suggest contrasting functions of this protein family in tumorigenesis.

    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognized not only for its acute effects but also for its ability to cause LongCOVID Syndrome (LCS), a condition characterized by persistent symptoms affecting multiple organ systems. This review examines the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying LCS, with a particular focus on autophagy inhibition, chronic inflammation, oxidative, nitrosative and calcium stress, viral persistence and autoimmunology. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms involved in LCS include (1) autoimmune activation, (2) latent viral persistence, where SARS-CoV-2 continues to influence host metabolism, (3) reactivation of latent pathogens such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV), exacerbating immune and metabolic dysregulation, and (4) possible persistent metabolic and inflammatory dysregulation, where the body fails to restore post-infection homeostasis. The manipulation of cellular pathways by SARS-CoV-2 proteins is a critical aspect of the virus' ability to evade immune clearance and establish long-term dysfunction. Viral proteins such as NSP13, ORF3a and ORF8 have been shown to disrupt autophagy, thereby impairing viral clearance and promoting immune evasion. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulated calcium signaling, oxidative stress, chronic HIF-1α activation and Nrf2 inhibition create a self-sustaining inflammatory feedback loop that contributes to tissue damage and persistent symptoms. Therefore understanding the molecular basis of LCS is critical for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Targeting autophagy and Nrf2 activation, glycolysis inhibition, and restoration calcium homeostasis may provide novel strategies to mitigate the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future research should focus on personalized therapeutic interventions based on the dominant molecular perturbations in individual patients.",

    "abstract": "The primary choice to summarize a finite collection of random objects is by using measures of central tendency, such as mean and median. In the field of optimal transport, the Wasserstein barycenter corresponds to the Fréchet or geometric mean of a set of probability measures, which is defined as a minimizer of the sum of squared distances to each element in a given set with respect to the Wasserstein distance of order 2. We introduce the Wasserstein median as a robust alternative to the Wasserstein barycenter. The Wasserstein median corresponds to the Fréchet median under the 2 -Wasserstein metric. The existence and consistency of the Wasserstein median are first established, along with its robustness property. In addition, we present a general computational pipeline that employs any recognized algorithms for the Wasserstein barycenter in an iterative fashion and demonstrate its convergence. The utility of the Wasserstein median as a robust measure of central tendency is demonstrated using real and simulated data.",

The potential of this technology to defame and cause harm is clear. However, despite the grave concerns expressed about deepfakes, these concerns are rarely accompanied with empirical evidence. We present a scoping review of the existing empirical studies that aim to investigate the effects of viewing deepfakes on people's beliefs, memories, and behaviour. Five databases were searched, producing an initial sample of 2004 papers, from which 22 relevant papers were identified, varying in methodology and research methods used. Overall, we found that the early studies on this topic have often produced inconclusive findings regarding the existence of uniquely persuasive or convincing effects of deepfake exposure. Moreover, many experiments demonstrated poor methodology and did not include a non-deepfake comparator (e.g., text-based misinformation). We conclude that speculation and scare mongering about dystopian uses of deepfake technologies has far outpaced experimental research that assess these harms. We close by offering insights on how to conduct improved empirical work in this area.",

    "abstract": "T cells play a central role in anti-tumor immunity, yet their function is often compromised within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, leading to cancer progression and resistance to immunotherapies. T-cell activation and differentiation require dynamic metabolic shifts, with mitochondrial metabolism playing a crucial role in sustaining their function. Research in cancer immunometabolism has revealed key mitochondrial abnormalities in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, including reduced mitochondrial capacity, depolarization, structural defects, and elevated reactive oxygen species. While these mitochondrial disruptions are well-characterized in solid tumors and linked to T-cell exhaustion, their impact on T-cell immunity in lymphoproliferative disorders remains underexplored. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most prevalent chronic adult leukemia, is marked by profound T-cell dysfunction that limits the success of adoptive cell therapies. Emerging studies are shedding light on the role of mitochondrial disturbances in CLL-related T-cell dysfunction, but significant knowledge gaps remain.

    "abstract": "Intravesical injections of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) are effective for treating refractory overactive bladder (OAB) in women. However, the adverse effects linked to the injections, such as hematuria, pain, and infection, and need for repeated injections can lower patient compliance and make the treatment inconvenient. Hence, urologists are actively pursuing less invasive and more convenient methods for the intravesical delivery of BTX-A. Advances in nanotechnology have facilitated noninvasive intravesical drug delivery. Currently, liposomes, hydrogels, nanoparticles, and many other forms of carriers can be used to enhance bladder wall permeability. This facilitates the entry of BTX-A into the bladder wall, allowing it to exert its effects. In this review, the feasibility and efficacy of liposomes, thermosensitive hydrogels, and hyaluronic acid-phosphatidylethanolamine for the treatment of OAB in women are discussed along with recent animal experiments on the use of nanotechnology-delivered BTX-A for the treatment of OAB in female rat models. Although the clinical efficacy of nanocarrier-encapsulated BTX-A for the treatment of OAB in women has not yet matched that of direct urethral muscle injection of BTX-A, improvements in certain symptoms indicate the potential of bladder instillation of nanocarrier-encapsulated BTX-A for future clinical applications. Consequently, further research on nanomaterials is warranted to advance the development of nanocarriers for the noninvasive delivery of BTX-A in the bladder.",

    "abstract": "Depression has become one of the most common mental disorders in the world. The rising incidence rate and disability rate pose a serious challenge to public health and socio-economic development. Traditional medication and psychotherapy are positive, but they often come with limitations such as side effects, poor compliance, and resource constraints, which highlights the urgent need for more proactive and sustainable non pharmacological interventions. We mainly explored the physiological and psychological mechanisms of exercise in alleviating depression in different age groups. In particular, we evaluated the characteristics and influencing factors of depression in each age group and compared the pathways through which exercise works, aiming to provide scientific basis for clinical practice and public health policies, and strengthen the application of non pharmacological treatment in depression management. It is worth noting that, in the context of a comprehensive search and analysis of recent literature, we have covered the epidemiology of depression, the impact of exercise on mental health, the characteristics of depression in different age groups, and the specific ways in which exercise alleviates depression through physiological and psychological mechanisms. Exercise alleviates symptoms of depression by regulating neurotransmitters, enhancing neuroplasticity, regulating hormone levels, reducing inflammatory responses through physiological pathways, as well as enhancing cognitive function, strengthening emotional regulation, triggering social interactions, and improving self-efficacy through psychological pathways. The differences in physiological and psychological mechanisms among different age groups determine the age dependent characteristics of exercise in mitigating depression. Teenagers, middle-aged people, and elderly people can improve depressive symptoms by enhancing neural progression, regulating stress responses, and strengthening social support, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis, a progressive and degenerative joint disease, disrupts the integrity of the entire joint structure, underscoring the urgency of identifying more effective therapeutic strategies and innovative targets. Among these, exercise therapy is considered a key component in the early management of osteoarthritis, functioning by stimulating the secretion of myokines from the skeletal muscle system. Irisin, a myokine predominantly secreted by skeletal muscle during exercise and encoded by the FNDC5 gene, has garnered attention for its regulatory effects on bone health. Emerging evidence suggests that irisin may play a protective role in osteoarthritis by promoting tissue homeostasis, enhancing subchondral bone density and microstructure, and inhibiting chondrocyte apoptosis. By improving chondrocyte viability, preserving extracellular matrix integrity, and maintaining homeostasis in osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes, irisin emerges as a promising therapeutic target for osteoarthritis. This review delves into the role of irisin in osteoarthritis pathogenesis, highlighting its influence on cartilage and bone metabolism as well as its dynamic relationship with exercise. Additionally, this review suggests that further exploration on its specific molecular mechanisms, optimization of drug delivery systems, and strategic utilization of exercise-induced benefits will be pivotal in unlocking the full potential of irisin as a novel intervention for osteoarthritis.",

Previous pilot studies have demonstrated that dogs can effectively distinguish positive samples from negative samples in humans with breast cancer, achieving sensitivity rates as high as 100%. However, questions remain about dogs' ability to detect low concentrations of volatile organic compounds in complex medium. While dogs' detection thresholds for isoamyl acetate using a mineral oil substrate have been studied, there are no current studies on their detection limits using more complex substrates like urine, relevant in clinical settings. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the olfactory threshold of dogs using artificial urine with various concentrations of isoamyl acetate. Two dogs were trained to detect isoamyl acetate, initially using water as the substrate during the training phase, and subsequently using artificial urine during the testing phase, under single and double-blinded conditions. The dogs were trained to indicate the presence of isoamyl acetate solutions by sitting in front of the positive sample and ignoring controls. Training and testing occurred in a controlled environment, maintaining consistency with the same two handlers, a standardized methodology, and positive reinforcement with toy rewards.

However, during the summer, sperm MMP was significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.01) lower in fresh samples and after 72 h of storage. Season had a significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) effect on the following sperm kinematics parameters: average path velocity, straight-line velocity, curve linear velocity, amplitude of lateral head displacement, and beat cross frequency. Semen characteristics were significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.01) improved in winter after 72 h of cold storage compared with those in summer. The summer season had a significant effect (<i>p</i> < 0.01) on seminal plasma antioxidant biomarkers (TAC, MDA, CAT, and GPx). Furthermore, the farrowing rate was significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) higher in the winter season. In conclusion, our results showed that the low MMP of boar sperm and the downregulation of seminal plasma antioxidant biomarkers in summer lead to poor semen quality and poor fertility in Hampshire-Ghungroo crossbred boars in a subtropical climate. To alleviate the heat-stress-induced poor sperm fertility in boars and to optimize the fertility of boars during summer in subtropics, there is a need for scientific interventions in terms of genetics [less exotic inheritance (below 50%)], nutrition, and management.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbiota with co-abundant behaviors is considered belonging to the same guild in micro-ecosystem. In this study, we established co-abundance networks of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) among 2944 Chinese adults from the Shanghai Men's and Women's Health Studies and observed a positive connection-dominated scale-free network using Sparse Correlations for Compositional data (SparCC). The closeness centrality was negatively correlated with other degree-based topological metrics in the network, indicating the isolated modularization of the bacteria. A total of 130 guilds were constructed, with a high modularity of 0.68, and retaining more diversity of OTUs than genus classification. The scores of guild structure similarity for comparisons between all, the healthy and the unhealthy subjects were higher than those derived from randomized permutations, suggesting a robust guild structure. We further used the constructed 130 guilds as the aggregation units to identify gut microbiota that may be associated with type 2 diabetes, and found that the OTUs in 21 significant guilds relevant to diabetes belonged to 19 of 41 (46.3%) previously reported genera (derived from Disbiome database), while only 10 (24.4%) showed different abundances between diabetes patients and healthy subjects in genus-based analysis. Our study reveals modularization of gut microbiota as guilds in Chinese populations, and demonstrates advantages of guild-based analysis in identifying diabetes-related gut bacteria. The analytical method based on microbial networks should be widely used to deepen our understanding of the role of gut microbiota in human health.",

The plant growth-promoting bacteria in the residue of PAD have the potential to enhance crop production, particularly during cold winter months. In this context, the characteristics of cultivable, cold-tolerant bacteria isolated from digestate obtained during PAD were investigated. Of the 20 isolates, 12 (60%) were able to solubilize phosphate from insoluble compounds at 15°C. Furthermore, nine (45%) and six (30%) isolates exhibited nitrogen fixation activity and produced indole acetic acid (IAA), respectively, while only two (10%) isolates were capable of producing siderophores. Hydrolytic enzyme production varied with cellulase production observed as a common trait since all isolates produced varying levels of cellulase ranging from 3.3 ± 0.5 to 15.3 ± 4 mm activity diameter. Isolates <i>Comamonas</i> sp._A3-1, <i>Acinetobacter iwoffi</i>_B5-1, and <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp._B5-5 displayed maximum cellulolytic activity with activity diameters of 13 ± 2, 13 ± 1.2, and 15.3 ± 4 mm, respectively.

    "abstract": "Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR) is a complex etiology disease that significantly impacts female fertility, endocrine function, and overall health status. In recent years, the incidence of DOR has been increasing, yet therapeutic methods remain relatively limited, particularly for patients with reproductive needs who often require Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) treatments. Growth Hormone (GH), a peptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary, promotes growth in bones, viscera, and multiple organs and systems throughout the body, enhances protein synthesis, and influences fat and mineral metabolism, playing a crucial role in human growth and development. Its levels decrease with the aging of the organism. In recent years, studies have suggested that a decline in growth hormone levels may be one of the causes of decreased ovarian function, leading to the application of GH in assisted reproductive treatments for patients with DOR. An increasing body of research indicates that GH can improve ovarian function through mechanisms such as antioxidant stress, promotion of follicle development, and enhancement of oocyte quality, and it also shows potential to improve endometrial receptivity, making GH a promising safe and effective strategy in ART for DOR patients.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic peripheral nerve injuries frequently result in irreversible functional deficits. While neurons possess an intrinsic capacity for axonal regeneration, the temporal constraints and the slow pace of neurite outgrowth often impede the complete restoration of sensory and motor capabilities. This impairment, often culminating in chronic disability, represents a significant clinical challenge, as there are currently no approved pharmacological interventions available to accelerate axon regeneration and improve functional recovery. This perspective focuses on recent scientific advancements that have identified sesquiterpene lactones, a family of naturally derived plant metabolites, as potential therapeutic candidates for treating peripheral nerve trauma. Preclinical investigations employing parthenolide and cnicin have revealed that these compounds can substantially augment axonal extension and functional recovery in diverse <i>in vivo</i> animal paradigms and primary human neuronal cultures. The favorable bioavailability of cnicin following oral administration, coupled with its notable tolerability at dosages considerably largely surpassing the therapeutic range, underscores its substantial potential as an effective pharmacological treatment for addressing the challenges associated with nerve regeneration and restoring sensory and motor functions.",

Cases of new-onset and relapsing vaccine-related glomerular diseases, including minimal change disease (MCD), antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, immunoglobulin (Ig)G4-related disease, and IgA nephropathy (IgAN), have been reported. Methods We present 30 patients who developed glomerular diseases after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. We evaluated the clinical characteristics, vaccine types, and outcomes of 30 patients whose urinalysis results indicated proteinuria and/or occult blood after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. For a definitive diagnosis, we performed a renal biopsy and evaluated their histological findings. Results Out of 30 patients, 19 (63.3%) were female, and 11 (36.7%) were male. The median age of the patient was 42.5 years (range, 24-66 years). Seventy-three percent of the patients received BioNTech Pfizer vaccines, and 26.7% received Moderna vaccines (mRNA-1273). Gross hematuria was observed in 83.3% of the patients, and 13.3% had nephrotic syndrome. Twenty patients with IgAN were diagnosed by renal biopsy, while the remaining were diagnosed with MCD (n=3), proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal Ig deposits (PGNMID) (n=1), TAFRO syndrome (characterized by thrombocytopenia, anasarca (edema, pleural effusion, and ascites), fever, reticulin fibrosis/renal dysfunction, and organomegaly; n=1), and anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease (n=1). Four patients who previously underwent treatment for IgAN experienced exacerbation of urinary abnormalities and disease relapse. Conclusion In conclusion, various glomerular diseases were newly diagnosed after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination.

(TA), <i>Tamarix chinensis</i> Lour. (TC), and <i>Hibiscus moscheutos</i> Linn. (HM). The results indicated that the planting of TC, TA, and HM effectively reduced soil electrical conductivity (EC) by 82.9, 88.3, and 86.2%, respectively. TC and TA significantly decreased the pH from 8.79 to 8.35 and 8.06, respectively, (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Moreover, the nutrient content and enzymatic activities were enhanced. Notably, TA exhibited the most significant soil nutrient improvement.

    "abstract": "Hemp seed oil is a valuable source of unsaturated fatty acids. However, its high degree of unsaturation makes it highly susceptible to oxidation, which can compromise its quality and nutritional value. Enhancing its stability can be achieved by incorporating antioxidant compounds naturally present in the seeds. A deeper understanding of the interactions between the extraction process and the oil's composition would provide valuable insights for optimizing both its stability and bioactive properties. In this context, this study was aimed at investigating and optimizing the microwave-assisted extraction of hemp seed oil, enriched with bioactive compounds, using response surface methodology. Three extraction factors were investigated: microwave power (600, 750, and 900 W), cosolvent percentage (0%, 5%, and 10% ethanol relative to hexane), and extraction time (5, 10, and 15 min). Several responses were studied, including oil yield, total phenolic content (TPC), total tocopherols, oxidative stability index (OSI), chlorophylls, carotenoids, quality indices (peroxide value and conjugates [diene and triene]), and color (<i>L</i>∗, <i>a</i>∗, <i>b</i>∗, <i>C</i>∗⁣<sub>ab</sub>, and <i>h</i> <sub>ab</sub>). The optimum extraction conditions were 800 W, 7.5% EtOH, and 13.60 min, reaching a maximum yield of 30.69%.

Rapid advancements in the research scale and technological upgrades necessitate evaluating new methods to ensure reliability and precision in microbial community profiling. We systematically evaluated the performance of eight recent and commonly used extraction methods using a microbial mock community (MMC) and fecal samples from two healthy volunteers, incorporating bacterial, archaeal, and fungal constituents. Performance metrics included nucleic acid assessment, microbial profile assessment, and scalability for large-scale studies, leveraging shotgun metagenomics for in-depth analysis. Despite variations in DNA quantity and quality, all methods yielded sufficient DNA for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. In the MMC microbial profile assessment, the QIAamp PowerFecal pro Kit (PF) and DNeasy PowerSoil HTP kit (PS) methods exhibited higher similarity with the theoretical composition and lower variability across technical replicates compared to other methods. For fecal samples, the extraction method accounted for 21.4% of the overall microbiome variation and significantly affected the abundances of 32% of detected microbial species. Methods using mechanical lysis with small beads, such as PF and PS, demonstrated better efficiency, indicated by increased microbial diversity in extracting DNA from Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, the PF and PS methods are notably simple to execute and automation-friendly, though relatively costly.

This study aims to evaluate the effects of OFS on wheat grain micronutrients and bioavailability across five sites in Shandong Province from 2021 to 2022. All experimental sites included five common treatments: control, traditional farming, optimized practices, and 15 and 30% OFS for chemical nitrogen. The results revealed regional variation in wheat yield; the average wheat yield was 9.06 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>, and the highest yield was 9.58 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> in the 15%OF treatment. No significant differences in soil micronutrient availability were observed. Compared to the control, the OFS treatments exhibited significant increases in grain Fe (24.69%) and Zn (19.19%) contents. The OFS treatments significantly increased Fe and Zn bioavailability by reducing the PA/Fe and PA/Zn molar ratios. Organic fertilizer substitution also increased micronutrient nutritional yields and reduced the current health burden of Fe and Zn. Under the pessimistic scenario, the OFS treatment reduced health burdens of Zn and Fe deficiencies by 2.38 and 1.31%, respectively, whereas these mitigation efficiencies substantially increased to 7.15 and 3.94% under the optimistic scenario. In conclusion, OFS improved the content and bioavailability of Fe and Zn without affecting yield, which enhanced the nutritional quality of these nutrients, and alleviate the health burden of Fe and Zn deficiency.

    "abstract": "Approximately 75% of epilepsy cases emerge in childhood, and 10%-30% of these pediatric epilepsy cases are resistant to standard drug therapies; however, the underlying causes of resistance remain poorly understood. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a primary contributor to pediatric epilepsy and is often associated with drug resistance. We performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and patch-clamp recording of fresh brain tissue samples that were obtained from pediatric FCD patients during surgery. Our study revealed significant transcriptomic changes across multiple subtypes of excitatory neurons and GABAergic neurons. Among the identified neuronal subtypes, the three inhibitory neuronal subtypes PVALB_RGS5, VIP_CRH, and SST_PENK presented prominent transcriptomic alterations related to epilepsy. The expression of genes enriched in epilepsy-related signaling pathways, especially those associated with excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance and energy metabolism, was significantly altered in these neuronal subtypes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the PVALB_RGS5 subtype were particularly enriched in pathways related to synaptic function. Recordings from fast-spiking (FS)/parvalbumin-containing neurons in brain sections from patients with FCD revealed a reduction in excitatory synaptic inputs, which indicates fewer synaptic inputs onto these neurons and lower activity. In addition, astrocyte subtype 4 exhibited distinct metabolic characteristics and interaction patterns with neuronal subtypes, which suggests their significant role in epilepsy pathophysiology. Our findings indicate that several specific neuronal and astrocyte subtypes play critical roles in the genesis and/or progression of drug-resistant pediatric seizures and that targeting these subtypes may represent a new treatment option.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a known risk factor for corneal epithelial defects (CEDs) after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), but it is unclear if diabetes severity or specific diabetic risk factors are associated with an increased risk of CED. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to identify factors associated with CED and healing time in association with diabetes severity in diabetic patients following PPV. The electronic health record database at University of Florida in Gainesville was queried to identify patients who underwent PPV for retinal detachment (RD) between April 2016 and April 2022. Patient charts were reviewed for clinical data including type of diabetes (if present), diabetes duration and severity, and associated diabetic comorbidities. The main outcome measures included presence of a CED within one month postoperatively, treatment of CED if present, and CED healing time. A total of 637 patients were analyzed, with a total of 243 eyes (26.5%) that belonged to diabetic patients. The diabetic patients were further separated into a proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) group and a nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) group. Diabetes was associated with the development of an initial CED (<i>p</i>=0.040), consistent with existing literature. There was not a significant difference in CED risk when comparing NPDR and PDR patients, although PDR patients tended to have more severe long-term outcomes with persistent corneal epithelial defects (PCEDs). This suggests that PDR patients may still require closer monitoring and earlier intervention for postoperative CED following PPV, as compared to the NPDR patient population.",

    "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a rare but well-known trigger for acute myositis. Diagnosis is primarily based on the clinical presentation and an accounting laboratory profile. Patients with mitochondrial dysfunction are potentially at a higher risk of myopathic exacerbations upon exposure to acute insults. This is due to the high energy requirements of myofibers and their reliance on sufficient mitochondrial performance. Hence, any mitochondrial insult can compromise the function of myofibers. This has implications on the management of people with pre-existing mitochondrial dysfunction, with scope for preventative measures and a lower threshold for diagnosis of myopathies. Usually, management is limited to conservative measures. Medications which predispose to muscle injury need to be withheld during the acute episode and their long-term need reviewed based on a risk-benefit analysis.

We find a non-linear effect of the menstrual cycle, with pattern separation performance peaking in the high-estradiol, late follicular phase and reaching its lowest point during the mid-luteal phase, which is characterized by moderate estradiol and high progesterone levels. Additionally, we find that perceived stress may facilitate pattern separation performance.

    "abstract": "This article provides an overview of the philosophy of Gilbert Hottois, who is usually credited with popularizing the concept of technoscience. Hottois starts from a metaphilosophy of language that diagnoses twentieth-century philosophy as fixated on language at the expense of technology. As an alternative, he developed a philosophy of technoscience that reinterprets science as primarily an intervening and technical activity rather than a contemplative and theoretical one. As I will argue, Hottois articulates the nature of this technicity through a philosophy of time, reflecting on the specific temporality of technoscience as distinct from human history. This temporality of technoscience provoked the need for ethical reflection, since technoscience is constantly changing and transforming the world. This led to Hottois's engagement with bioethics, in which he sought to develop a framework capable of \"guiding\" technoscience. Aiming to avoid both total symbolic closure and total technical openness, this guidance is concerned with the preservation of diversity, especially the human capacity for ethics, ethicity. This idea of guidance was later taken up by Dutch philosophers such as Hans Achterhuis and Peter-Paul Verbeek, inspiring their empirical turn in the philosophy of technology. What remains missing in this framework, however, is Hottois's critical analysis of the different temporalities at work in technology and culture.",

    "abstract": "Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (NCPE) is a rare but serious complication of heroin overdose, more frequently observed in fatal cases. This report discusses a 33-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension and heroin use disorder who presented with dyspnea and hypoxia. Upon examination, his vital signs indicated an SpO<sub>2</sub> of 82% on room air, along with tachycardia and tachypnea. The patient disclosed heroin use the day before admission, and urine toxicology screening confirmed the presence of opioids and methadone. Pulmonary auscultation revealed bilateral crackles, while chest imaging, including chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest, revealed diffuse bilateral airspace opacities consistent with pulmonary edema, effectively ruling out pulmonary embolism. Arterial blood gas analysis indicated acute respiratory acidosis, which improved with oxygen therapy. A prior echocardiogram had shown normal cardiac function. Notably, diuretics were not administered, and the patient's oxygen requirements decreased within two days. NCPE is a diagnosis of exclusion, often characterized by persistent hypoxia following the resolution of opioid-induced respiratory depression, with radiographic evidence of pulmonary edema. The condition typically resolves within 24-48 hours with supportive care, as observed in this case. While NCPE is frequently identified during autopsy in heroin-related fatalities, its underlying pathophysiology remains poorly understood. NCPE should be considered in the differential diagnosis of respiratory failure in patients with heroin overdose. Given its potentially fatal consequences and the limited understanding of its pathophysiology, further research is warranted to optimize management strategies.",

Therefore, their potential for inducing ketoacidosis, even in the presence of normal glucose levels, requires careful monitoring. We describe the case of a 78-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes treated with the SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin and the biguanide metformin, who presented after several days of reduced food and fluid intake due to nausea and diarrhoea to the emergency department.

To address this issue, we developed a novel approach using Ångstrom-scale silver particles (AgÅPs) with broad-spectrum antibacterial properties. Specifically, we formulated a polyethylene glycol hydrogel infused with AgÅPs (Gel-AgÅPs) designed for treating fracture fixation infections. This novel hydrogel formulation is injectable, ensuring precise adherence to both the exposed tissue and fracture surfaces, thereby allowing the direct targeted action of AgÅPs at the infection site. The Gel-AgÅPs significantly reduced the infection caused by Escherichia coli (a model pathogen of orthopedic implant infection) in a murine femoral fracture model. Moreover, the Gel-AgÅPs-treated infected fractures healed completely within 6 weeks, exhibiting bone formation and mechanical strength comparable to those of uninfected fractures. Further analysis revealed a significant downregulation of local inflammatory response as evidenced by a lower expression of inflammatory markers in Gel-AgÅPs-treated fractures compared to untreated infected controls. Furthermore, Gel-AgÅPs exhibited a unique ability to inhibit osteoclast differentiation, a critical factor in infection-induced bone degradation, without impacting osteoblast activity. In conclusion, Gel-AgÅPs exerted a dual therapeutic effect by eradicating bacterial infection and mitigating inflammation-induced osteoclast activity, thereby expediting infected fracture healing. This innovative approach is a promising therapeutic alternative to conventional antibiotic treatments, potentially transforming the treatment landscape for orthopedic implant-associated infections.",

The genus Lanius, known for its distinctive pigmentation patterns, shows considerable variability within species, making it an intriguing but poorly understood group. We applied Explainable AI (XAI) methods to uncover pigmentation patterns that represent species-wide identification signatures. To do this, we used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify shrike eggs and explore potential correlations between egg identification and eggshell patterns. Our CNN model achieved over 95% accuracy in predicting species, but identifying specific discriminative features proved difficult, as the model only highlighted general trends. This method could help organize collections and verify species affiliation in global ornithological collections, which often face challenges such as missing or illegible labels. CNNs can enhance species identification and improve the accuracy of ornithological studies. Despite some challenges, the potential applications of this research in avian biology and museum collections are promising.

    "abstract": "This research paper presents the design and development of an indigenous low cost Mobile Mapping System (MMS) for urban surveying applications. The MMS is comprised of economical Hokuyo-30LX 2D laser scanners, vision sensors, Global Positioning System (GPS) and various odometric sensors that can be installed on car like moving platform. The run time sensorial data is interfaced, processed and recorded using Robot Operating System (ROS). The live laser scan is utilized for the pose estimation using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technique. In absence of valid SLAM estimation and frequent GPS outages, a multimodal sensor fusion framework for the enhanced pose correction has been developed using Kalman Filter (KF) by incorporating the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and wheel odometric data along with SLAM and GPS data. The corrected pose is utilized for the 3D point cloud mapping by incorporating laser scans perceived periodically from various 2D laser scanners mounted on the MMS. The custom-made installation scheme has been followed for mounting three 2D laser scanners at horizontal, vertical and inclined orientations. The efficacy of the developed map has employed for extraction of road edges and associated road assets by establishing the lucrative classification technique of the point cloud using Split and Merge segmentation and Hough transformation. The surveying to map development time has significantly reduced and the mapping results have found quite accurate when matched with the ground truths. Furthermore, the comparison of the developed maps with ground truths and GIS tools reveals the highly acceptable accuracy of the generated results which have found very nearly aligned with the actual urban environment features. In comparison to the existing global MMS variants, the presented MMS is quite affordable solution for limited financial resourced business entities.",

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is marked by aggressive characteristics and a poor prognosis. The involvement of KCNJ2, an inward rectifying potassium channel, in the progression of ccRCC, along with its potential roles in immune modulation and metabolic pathways, remains unclear. <b>Methods:</b> The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was utilized to analyze the gene expression, clinicopathological characteristics, and clinical relevance of KCNJ2. The prognostic value of KCNJ2 in ccRCC was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. The TCGA-KIRC dataset was utilized to analyze tumor microenvironment (TME), focusing on tumor-infiltrating immune cells and immunomodulators. The biological functions of KCNJ2 were investigated in vitro using CCK-8, flow cytometry, wound healing, transwell, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting assays. <b>Results:</b> KCNJ2 expression was notably higher in ccRCC than in normal kidney tissues, with increased levels associated with advanced tumor stages. However, KCNJ2 did not exhibit obvious prognostic value. Coexpression analysis identified associations with genes implicated in energy metabolism. Analysis of the TME and immune profile indicated a link between KCNJ2 expression and immune cell infiltration, along with particular immune checkpoints. <i>In vitro</i> studies demonstrated that KCNJ2 overexpression enhanced cell proliferation, migration, invasion, glucose production, and ATP generation. <b>Conclusion:</b> KCNJ2 plays a crucial role in ccRCC progression through affecting glucose metabolism and immune responses. Our findings reveal the functional role of KCNJ2 in promoting tumor progression and metabolic reprogramming in ccRCC, highlighting its therapeutic potential as a novel target for ccRCC treatment. Further studies are essential to clarify the mechanisms by which KCNJ2 affects ccRCC biology and to evaluate its clinical relevance.",

    "abstract": "Antibody maturation in the lymphoid follicle produces antibodies with improved binding affinity. This process requires iterative rounds of mutation and B cell expansion, supported by T cells that recognize epitopes presented on the B cell's MHC-II. In this comprehensive antibody repertoire analysis, we find that established regulatory T cell epitopes (Tregitopes) decline in maturing antibody sequences as somatic hypermutation (SHM) increases, but potential T effector epitopes do not decline. A previous analysis of B cell receptor (BCR)-derived HLA-DR epitopes present in memory antibody repertoires from seven healthy human donors revealed a decrease in donor-specific epitope content with SHM. Moreover, T cell epitope depletion was associated with class-switching and long-term secretion of antibody into serum. Significant depletion of high-affinity germline-encoded epitopes in high SHM sequences was also observed, but the predicted phenotype of T cells responding to the BCR-derived epitopes (regulatory vs. effector) was not previously evaluated.",

Increasing evidence indicates that NASH is responsible for a significant share of idiopathic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases, a fatal cancer with a 5-year survival rate below 22%. Biomarkers can facilitate early screening and monitoring of at-risk NAFLD/NASH patients and assist in identifying potential drug candidates for treatment. This study utilized an ensemble feature selection framework to analyze transcriptomic data, identifying biomarker genes associated with the stage-wise progression of NAFLD-related HCC. Seven machine learning algorithms were assessed for disease stage classification. Twelve feature selection methods including correlation-based techniques, mutual information-based methods, and embedded techniques were utilized to rank the top genes as features, through this approach, multiple feature selection methods were combined to yield more robust features important in this disease progression. Cox regression-based survival analysis was carried out to evaluate the biomarker potentiality of these genes. Furthermore, multiphase drug repurposing strategy and molecular docking were employed to identify potential drug candidates against these biomarkers. Among the seven machine learning models initially evaluated, DISCR resulted as the most accurate disease stage classifier. Ensemble feature selection identified ten top genes, among which eight were recognized as potential biomarkers based on survival analysis. These include genes ABAT, ABCB11, MBTPS1, and ZFP1 mostly involved in alanine and glutamate metabolism, butanoate metabolism, and ER protein processing. Through drug repurposing, 81 candidate drugs were found to be effective against these markers genes, with Diosmin, Esculin, Lapatinib, and Phenelzine as the best candidates screened through molecular docking and MMGBSA.

In this study, we investigated the effects of cardamonin, a natural compound potential to suppress various malignancies, on the lipid anabolism in ovarian cancer. Cell proliferation was assessed using CCK-8 and clone formation assay. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was measured with JC-10 probe. Free fatty acids (FFA) was measured by fluorescence using acyl-CoA oxidation and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1) activity was analyzed by spectrophotometric assay using palmitoyl-CoA and DTNB (5,5'-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) reaction. mRNA expression was measured by Quantitative Real-Time PCR. Protein expression was analyzed through western blotting and immunofluorescence. Raptor was knocked down by shRNA and Raptor was overexpressed by lentiviral transfection. The antitumor effect of cardamonin was evaluated using a xenotransplantation tumor bearing mouse model. Cardamonin suppressed the cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis and triggered mitochondrial damage in ovarian cancer cells. Cardamonin inhibited the protein expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and its downstream lipogenic enzymes and decreased FFA content and CPT-1 activity. Additionally, cardamonin inhibited the activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and expression of regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor). Raptor knockdown abolished the inhibitory effect of cardamonin on mTORC1 and SREBP1. Furthermore, cardamonin inhibited mTORC1 activation and lipogenic proteins expression induced by Raptor overexpression. Cardamonin reduced the tumor growth and fatty acid synthase of the tumors, as evidenced by decreased expression of Ki-67 and FASN.

RT-PCR analysis is a powerful technique for quantifying gene expression, but normalization of expression data is critical to control experimental errors. Using stable reference genes, also known as housekeeping genes, is a common strategy for normalization, yet reference gene selection often lacks proper validation. In this work, our goal was to determine the most stable reference genes in E. ictaluri during catfish serum exposure and various growth phases. To this goal, we evaluated the expression of 27 classical reference genes (16S rRNA, abcZ, adk, arc, aroE, aspA, atpA, cyaA, dnaG, fumC, g6pd, gdhA, glnA, gltA, glyA, grpE, gyrB, mdh, mutS, pgi, pgm, pntA, recA, recP, rpoS, tkt, and tpi) using five analytical programs (GeNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder, Comparative ΔCT, and Comprehensive Ranking). Results showed that aspA, atpA, dnaG, glyA, gyrB, mutS, recP, rpoS, tkt, and tpi were the most stable reference genes during serum exposure, whereas fumC, g6pd, gdhA, glnA, and mdh were the least stable. During various growth phases, aspA, g6pd, glyA, gyrB, mdh, mutS, pgm, recA, recP, and tkt were the most stable, while 16S rRNA, atpA, grpE, and tpi were the least stable.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCOVID-19 disproportionately affected individuals from marginalized and underserved communities, and little research has investigated how COVID-19 might have impacted neurobehavioral symptoms in children from Latin America. What little research suggests that COVID-19 had a negative effect on neurobehavioral symptoms and that this effect was worse for individuals who were younger, had lower education, or other chronic conditions.ObjectiveThe purpose of the current study was to examine the change (before, during, and after) in neurobehavioral symptoms for a sample of Colombian children who tested positive for COVID-19 and to identify key predictors of post-COVID neurobehavioral impairments.MethodsThe Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory was administered to caregivers (92.90% female) of 85 children (51.80% female) by researchers in Colombia. Data was collected after the child had recovered from COVID-19 with retrospective questions about the child's function before and during COVID-19, as well as at the time of data collection.ResultsAt the domain level, caregivers reported large increases in children's somatic symptoms, a medium increase in affective symptoms, and a small increase in cognitive symptoms before vs. during COVID-19. Caregivers also noted a large increase in children's somatic symptoms, a medium increase in affective symptoms, and a small increase in cognitive symptoms before vs after COVID-19. The somatic symptom domain was the only category to see an improvement following infection (during vs after). Three separate linear regressions indicated that greater COVID-19 severity during the infection significantly predicted greater current (after COVID-19) somatic symptom severity, and the presence of a pre-existing respiratory disease significantly predicted greater current cognitive and affective symptom severity.ConclusionThis study highlights the importance of evaluating and treating neurobehavioral symptoms post-COVID-19 among children in Colombia and identifies this need in an underserved and under-researched population. Future research may examine whether early intervention and rehabilitation strategies help improve post-COVID-19 neurobehavioral symptoms for this group.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synucleinopathies, characterized by extracellular alpha-synuclein (αSyn or SNCA) accumulation and aggregation, have been linked to neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. P2RX7 is a non-selective cationic transmembrane purinergic receptor activated by elevated levels of extracellular ATP, which typically occurs during inflammatory conditions. Activation of P2RX7 by αSyn is implicated in neuronal degeneration, potentially causing pore dilation and increased inflammation. By integrating the data curation, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, along with structural analyses, we attempted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and binding sites for P2RX7-αSyn interaction. We elucidated interactions between P2RX7 and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of αSyn. Utilizing cryo-EM structures of P2RX7 in ATP-bound and unbound states, we assessed αSyn's effect on P2RX7 structural and functional dynamics. Initially, the analyses revealed that αSyn interactomes are mainly involved in mitochondrial functions, while P2RX7 interactors are linked to receptor internalization and calcium transport. Molecular docking with six tools identified that αSyn-NTD fragments preferentially bind to the proximal region of P2RX7's transmembrane domain. Microsecond all atom MD simulations in a POPS lipid bilayer showed significant atomic fluctuations, particularly in the head region, lower body, and large loop of P2RX7's cytoplasmic domain. Secondary structure analysis indicated unfolding in regions related to pore dilation and receptor desensitization. Further by contact-based and solvent accessibility analyses, along with protein structure network (PSN) studies, we identified crucial residues involved in αSyn-P2RX7 interactions. This understanding enhances the knowledge of how αSyn and P2RX7 interactions take place, potentially contributing to neurodegenerative diseases, and could be instrumental in developing future preventive and therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Lateral walking exercise is beneficial for the hip abductor enhancement. Accurate gait recognition and continuous hip joint angle prediction are essential for the control of exoskeletons. We propose a dual-task learning framework, the \"Twin Brother\" model, which fuses convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), neural networks (NNs), and the squeezing-elicited attention mechanism to classify the lateral gait stage and estimate the hip angle from electromyography (EMG) signals. The EMG signals of 6 muscles from 10 subjects during lateral walking were collected. Four gait phases were recognized, and the hip angles of both legs were continuously estimated. The sliding window length of 250 ms and the sliding increment of 3 ms were determined by the requirements of response time and recognition accuracy of the real-time system. We compared the performance of CNN-LSTM, CNN, LSTM, support vector machine, NN, K-nearest neighbor, and the \"Twin Brother\" models. The \"Twin Brother\" model achieved a recognition accuracy (mean ± SD) of 98.81% ± 0.14%.

We tested influence of continuous water stress on photosynthetic traits including Leaf Chlorophyll content (LCC) and Chlorophyll Fluorescence (ChlF) and combined hyperspectral reflectance as a high-throughput approach for early and non-destructive assessment of LCC and ChlF traits in <i>Rhamnus leptophylla</i> trees. LCC and ChlF parameters (NPQ, Fv'/Fm', ETR, ETRmax, Fm', qL, qP, Y(II) were measured alongside leaf hyperspectral reflectance from <i>Rhamnus leptophylla</i> suffering from constant drought during water stress. Water stress caused NPQ, Fv'/Fm', ETRmax, Fm', qL, qP, Y(II) and ETR continuous decline throughout the entire drought period. ChlF was more sensitive to drought monitoring than LCC. The original reflectance spectra and hyperspectral vegetation indices (SVIs) showed a strong correlation with LCC and ChlF. Reflectance in 540-560nm and 750-1100nm and selected SVI such as Simple Ratio (SR)752/690 can track drought responses effectively before leaves showed drought symptoms. Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR) and three machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were employed to develop models for estimating LCC and ChlF parameters. RF provided the best estimation accuracy for LCC compared to MLR, KNN and SVM, achieving an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.895 for all LCC samples. The canopy layer significantly influenced the estimation accuracy of LCC, with the middle layer yielding the highest R<sup>2</sup> value.

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> As the largest workforce in health, it is critically important that the principles of planetary health are incorporated into nursing education to have a significant influence on reducing the environmental impacts of health practices and address health inequities. Despite the adoption of sustainability principles by the higher education sector, the translation into nursing curriculum has been challenging. The increased integration of digital technologies in health contributes towards both sustainability in health and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Electronic health records (EHRs) are well documented in reducing the reliance on paper-based records and improve the efficiency of health delivery, including accessibility to health where information sharing barriers are reduced. The incorporation of digital health training, and specifically the use of simulated EHRs, into nursing curriculum will increase the application of the principles of planetary health into graduate practice. <b>Aims:</b> This study explored if the use of an EHR in a simulated learning environment (SLE) in a Bachelor of Nursing (BN) program can lead to tangible reduction in paper consumption. <b>Methods:</b> A nonexperimental, pre- and postdesign was used to audit the paper consumption, specifically paper-based manuals, within the SLE pre- and postimplementation of the HealthiERSim®, an in house developed simulated EHR system. The study was held across multiple campuses with different BN cohorts. <b>Results:</b> The study reported an overall reduction paper consumption by 12.59% post-implementation of HealthiERSim® and a reduction in pages per SLE manual, with a significant (<i>p</i> < 0.001) difference in paper consumption between the subjects. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results of this study indicate an effective implementation of an EHR solution can decrease paperconsumption within an SLE, contributing to reducing the environmental footprint of an educational institution. Where adopted with curriculum content about sustainable practices, this will increase graduate awareness and practice of planetary health principles and the SDGs.",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing recognition of the epistemic injustice perpetrated against individuals deemed mad, leading to a push for the inclusion of their voices in research and academia. Nevertheless, despite being predominantly enacted as progressive, the inclusion of individuals deemed mad within research practices and spaces often fails to disrupt the ways in which methodology is conceptualized and practiced, contributing to the ongoing psychiatrization and exclusion of Mad practices and, more broadly, failing to produce alternatives to carceral responses to madness. In this article, I consider both the potential for methodology to produce temporal violence as well as the potential of Mad Time to disrupt normative and often sanist research practices. To achieve this, I weave together theorizing on Mad Time, post-qualitative inquiry, the experiences of peer support workers, and my own temporal conflicts in attempting to madden research within academia. I propose three ways in which Mad Time may provoke alternative methodological practices that move us closer to epistemic justice: rethinking the concept of data, embracing stumbling, circling, scrambling (becoming), and valuing variations in pace. I conclude by reflecting on the possible implications that thinking with Mad Time might hold for both research and activism, both within and outside of academia.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to estimate the number of AMY2B gene copies and measure serum amylase activity in several Balkan dog breeds. Additionally, it explores the relationship between these genetic and biochemical parameters. Blood samples from 85 dogs representing eight breeds were collected, DNA was extracted, and AMY2B copy numbers were determined using droplet digital PCR. AMY2B gene copies ranged from 7.7 to 18.4, with a mean of 12.4 ± 2.2. Significant breed-related differences were observed (p = 0.025), with Istrian Wire-Haired Hounds showing the highest mean copy number (13.9 ± 1.5) and Posavatz Hounds the lowest (10.8 ± 1.5). Serum amylase activity ranged from 3.3 to 17.8 µkat/L, with a mean of 8.7 ± 2.6, and showed significant interbreed differences (p = 0.004), with Barak breed displaying the highest activity. Serum glucose levels varied widely, but no significant interbreed differences were detected (p = 0.340). No significant correlation was found between AMY2B copy numbers and serum amylase activity or glucose levels. The study concludes that Balkan dogs have AMY2B copy numbers similar to other European breeds, likely reflecting historical agricultural practices in the region, thereby facilitating better starch digestion. While significant variations exist among breeds, the lack of correlation between gene copy number and amylase activity suggests that other factors influence enzyme levels.",

Ankle kinesthesia and repositioning acuity, four square step test, center of pressure-related balance metrics, and PDQ-39 questionnaire were measured.ResultsAnkle kinesthesia in plantarflexion is improved after the exercises (p = 0.033). Four square step test time was significantly decreased (∼780 ms) after proprioceptive exercises (p = 0.008). Significant decreases in closed eyes postural metrics of the center of pressure's maximum excursion (p = 0.008), maximum velocity (p = 0.035), total mean velocity (p = 0.004), range (p = 0.002), and variability (p = 0.002) indicated reduced instabilities. Significant correlations between the proprioception and postural metrics in closed eyes standing before the exercises were vanished to corroborate the role of improved proprioception in boosted postural control.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an analysis of the area dependency of power and capacity density of wind farms, based on derivations of the available energy in the atmosphere and data on the power production of existing wind farms in the North Sea. The amount of available energy is determined by the mechanical energy budget of the atmospheric boundary layer and is found to be a function of C/A, where C is the circumference and A is the area of the wind farm. The actual power production of 31 wind farms is analyzed, and the power production in 23 of the largest wind farms follows the same functional form as the available energy, indicating that the power production in these wind farms is limited by the available energy. The power density in the North Sea, as a function of the area usage, is found by fitting the actual power density of existing wind farms to the expression for available energy in the atmospheric boundary layer. Wind farms below 10 km2 can produce more than 6 Wm-2, but the power density rapidly decreases with area. Wind farms with an area of about 1000 km2 will produce [Formula: see text] 1 Wm-2, and power densities will asymptotically approach a value of 0.78 [Formula: see text] 0.58 Wm-2 for increasing wind farm area. Since atmospheric energy input is the limiting factor for power production, an atmospheric energy budget is vital for a reliable estimate of offshore wind power potential.",
    "question": "What is the relationship between the area of a wind farm and its power production in the North Sea?",
    "answer": "Answer:\nThe power production of wind farms in the North Sea is found to be limited by the available energy in the atmosphere, with power density decreasing as the area of the wind farm increases. Wind farms below 10 km2 can produce more than 6 Wm-2, but power density rapidly decreases with area. Wind farms with an area of about 1000 km2 will produce less than 1 Wm-2, and power densities will approach a value of 0.78 to 0.58 Wm-2 for increasing wind farm area."
