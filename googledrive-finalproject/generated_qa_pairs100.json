    "abstract": "Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a cutting-edge strategy for combating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Unlike conventional antibiotics, SDT leverages the generation of reactive oxygen species during the treatment process to inflict multifaceted damage on bacterial cells, thereby significantly reducing the likelihood of developing drug resistance. Compared to other physical sterilisation methods, such as ultraviolet irradiation, SDT offers enhanced tissue penetration, making it particularly suitable for addressing deep-seated infections, including osteomyelitis. Despite its significant advantages, the clinical translation of SDT for antibacterial applications faces several challenges. This review discusses the fundamental mechanisms of SDT, with a focus on phenomena such as cavitation-induced reactions and piezocatalytic generation of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive analysis of various sonosensitisers used in SDT, emphasising their potential to enhance therapeutic outcomes in areas such as infected wound healing, bone regeneration, and the mitigation of deep tissue inflammation. While SDT shows great promise in addressing multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, further research and development are essential to overcome existing limitations and unlock its full clinical potential.",

    "abstract": "The protein heterodimer calprotectin and its component proteins, S100A8 and S100A9, play important antibacterial and pro-inflammatory roles in the mammalian innate immune response. Gaining mechanistic insights into the regulation and biological function of calprotectin will help facilitate patient diagnostics and therapy for inflammation and further our understanding of the host-microbe interface. Recent literature has identified zebrafish s100a10b as zebrafish calprotectin based on sequence similarity, genomic context, and transcriptional upregulation during the immune response to bacterial infections. The field would benefit from expanding the breadth of calprotectin studies into a zebrafish innate immunity model. Here, we carefully evaluated the possibility that zebrafish possess a calprotectin ortholog or a paralog that convergently evolved similar function. Using careful bioinformatics approaches, we found that zebrafish do not have an ortholog of either mammalian S100A8 or S100A9. To look for paralogs with convergent function, we identified four zebrafish s100 proteins-including s100a10b-that are expressed in immune cells and upregulated during the immune response. We recombinantly expressed and purified these proteins and measured their antimicrobial activity. None of the zebrafish proteins exhibited activity comparable to mammalian calprotectin. We also generated structural models of all homodimers and heterodimers of all annotated zebrafish s100 genes. None of these complexes were predicted to have an antimicrobial transition metal binding site equivalent to calprotectin. Finally, we measured the ability of our four purified zebrafish s100 proteins to activate inflammation via Toll-like receptor 4, a key feature of human S100A9; none of the proteins activated the receptor. Our work demonstrates conclusively that zebrafish have no ortholog of calprotectin and suggests that similar proteins have not convergently evolved analogous functions.",

The gut microbiome is modifiable by the diet, and in turn, it utilizes the undigested food components as substrates and generates a group of small molecule-metabolites that addressed as \"meta-metabolome\" in this review. Profiling and mapping of meta-metabolome could yield insightful information at higher resolution and serve as functional readouts for precision nutrition and formation of personalized dietary strategies.

    "abstract": "Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability worldwide, with ischemic stroke (IS) accounting for the vast majority of cases. This paper reviews the latest research on intestinal damage, changes in the gut microbiota, and related therapeutic strategies after IS. Following IS, the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier is compromised, leading to increased intestinal permeability. The gut microbiota can translocate to other organs, triggering systemic immune responses that inhibit recovery after IS. Moreover, the composition and proportion of the gut microbiota change after IS. The number of beneficial bacteria decreases, whereas the number of harmful bacteria increases. The production of beneficial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), is reduced, and the levels of harmful metabolites, such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), increase. Antibiotics after IS not only help prevent infection but also have neuroprotective effects. Although poststroke reperfusion therapy can effectively restore cerebral blood flow, it may also cause intestinal mucosal damage and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Nutritional support after IS can alter the gut microbiota structure and promote neurological recovery. Therefore, individualized treatment for IS patients is crucial. In summary, IS affects not only the brain but the entire body system, especially the gut. Intestinal damage and dysbiosis are critical in IS occurrence, development, and prognosis. By protecting the intestinal mucosa and modulating the structure of the gut microbiota, intestinal damage and related infections can be reduced, improving patient prognosis. Future research is needed to explore therapeutic methods targeting the gut microbiota, providing more comprehensive and effective treatment strategies for IS patients.",

    "abstract": "Chloroplast transformation technology has become a powerful platform for generating plants that express foreign proteins of pharmaceutical and agricultural importance at high levels. Chloroplasts are often chosen as attractive targets for the introduction of new agronomic traits because they have their own genome and protein synthesis machinery. Certain valuable traits have been genetically engineered into plastid genomes to improve crop yield, nutritional quality, resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses, and the production of industrial enzymes and therapeutic proteins. Synthetic biology approaches aim to play an important role in expressing multiple genes through plastid engineering, without the risk of pleiotropic effects in transplastomic plants. Despite many promising laboratory-level successes, no transplastomic crop has been commercialized to date. This technology is mostly confined to model species in academic laboratories and needs to be expanded to other agronomically important crop species to capitalize on its significant commercial potential. However, in recent years, some transplastomic lines are progressing in field trials, offering hope that they will pass regulatory approval and enter the marketplace. This review provides a comprehensive summary of new and emerging technologies employed for plastid transformation and discusses key synthetic biology elements that are necessary for the construction of modern transformation vectors. It also focuses on various novel insights and challenges to overcome in chloroplast transformation.",

    "abstract": "The placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) was previously called the morbidly adherent placenta. It involves a range of pathological adherence of the placenta, including placenta increta, placenta percreta and placenta accreta, depending on the depth of invasion of anchoring villi into the myometrium and beyond. This spectrum of disorder is becoming a frequently encountered problem as a consequence of rising caesarean rates all over the world. Hysterectomy during caesarean delivery (CD) has been the conventional management of PAS. However, associated complications have prompted conservative surgery at the first sitting, with or without interventional radiology. The aim is to reduce blood loss and conserve the uterus if possible. It was decided to review the available literature on this emerging topic. Using PubMed and Google Scholar, our search focused on articles published from 2004 onwards, utilizing search terms \"Placenta Accreta Spectrum\" OR \"Adherent Placenta\" and \"Caesarean Delivery\". The selection for review adhered to specified inclusion/exclusion criteria and finally focused on 50 articles. It was found that published work includes the following conservative approaches: first, to leave the placenta expecting autolysis and resolution; second, to leave the placenta with the intention of a delayed hysterectomy; and third, to resort to an intraoperative arterial occlusion and follow-up. Though the primary objective of reducing blood loss at initial surgery is usually achieved, the success of uterine preservation differs. The availability of a multidisciplinary team for the surgical management of PAS is an important factor to consider. Limiting the extent of surgery at the time of CD, combined with or without arterial embolization/ballooning/ligation, reduces blood loss and limits morbidity with the potential to preserve the uterus.",

    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of hematologic cancer characterized by the uncontrolled clonal expansion of plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). This leads to significant dysfunction and suppression of the immune system in affected patients. Myeloma cells employ sophisticated strategies to manipulate immune and non-immune cells, evading immune surveillance and enhancing their survival. One key factor in this evasion is the disruption of dendritic cell (DC)-mediated immune mechanisms. Extensive evidence indicates that in the presence of myeloma cells, DC numbers are notably reduced, and their phenotype and function are altered, impairing their ability to present antigens and activate robust T-cell responses effectively. Despite rapid advances in MM treatment, with promising strategies such as DC-based vaccines being already achieved, DC dysfunction remains a substantial hurdle, associated with or contributing to poor therapeutic outcomes, disease relapse, and MM's persistence as an incurable disease. To address these challenges, it is essential to understand the intricate mechanisms through which myeloma cells transform DCs into their \"accomplices,\" undermining immune responses. This review comprehensively summarizes the current understanding of the role of DCs in MM. Additionally, it evaluates the potential of DCs in anti-MM immunotherapy, discussing persistent challenges and highlighting emerging perspectives that may lead to promising breakthroughs for improved patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) act as crucial regulators of gene expression within cells, exerting precise control over processes such as RNA splicing, transport, localization, stability, and translation through their specific binding to RNA molecules. The diversity and complexity of RBPs are particularly significant in cancer biology, as they directly impact a multitude of RNA metabolic events closely associated with tumor initiation and progression. The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), as a member of the RBP family, is central to the neurodevelopmental disorder fragile X syndrome and increasingly recognized in the modulation of cancer biology through its influence on RNA metabolism. The protein's versatility, stemming from its diverse RNA-binding domains, enables it to govern a wide array of transcript processing events. Modifications in FMRP's expression or localization have been associated with the regulation of mRNAs linked to various processes pertinent to cancer, including tumor proliferation, metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cellular senescence, chemotherapy/radiotherapy resistance, and immunotherapy evasion. In this review, we emphasize recent findings and analyses that suggest contrasting functions of this protein family in tumorigenesis.

    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognized not only for its acute effects but also for its ability to cause LongCOVID Syndrome (LCS), a condition characterized by persistent symptoms affecting multiple organ systems. This review examines the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying LCS, with a particular focus on autophagy inhibition, chronic inflammation, oxidative, nitrosative and calcium stress, viral persistence and autoimmunology. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms involved in LCS include (1) autoimmune activation, (2) latent viral persistence, where SARS-CoV-2 continues to influence host metabolism, (3) reactivation of latent pathogens such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV), exacerbating immune and metabolic dysregulation, and (4) possible persistent metabolic and inflammatory dysregulation, where the body fails to restore post-infection homeostasis. The manipulation of cellular pathways by SARS-CoV-2 proteins is a critical aspect of the virus' ability to evade immune clearance and establish long-term dysfunction. Viral proteins such as NSP13, ORF3a and ORF8 have been shown to disrupt autophagy, thereby impairing viral clearance and promoting immune evasion. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulated calcium signaling, oxidative stress, chronic HIF-1α activation and Nrf2 inhibition create a self-sustaining inflammatory feedback loop that contributes to tissue damage and persistent symptoms. Therefore understanding the molecular basis of LCS is critical for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Targeting autophagy and Nrf2 activation, glycolysis inhibition, and restoration calcium homeostasis may provide novel strategies to mitigate the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future research should focus on personalized therapeutic interventions based on the dominant molecular perturbations in individual patients.",

    "abstract": "The primary choice to summarize a finite collection of random objects is by using measures of central tendency, such as mean and median. In the field of optimal transport, the Wasserstein barycenter corresponds to the Fréchet or geometric mean of a set of probability measures, which is defined as a minimizer of the sum of squared distances to each element in a given set with respect to the Wasserstein distance of order 2. We introduce the Wasserstein median as a robust alternative to the Wasserstein barycenter. The Wasserstein median corresponds to the Fréchet median under the 2 -Wasserstein metric. The existence and consistency of the Wasserstein median are first established, along with its robustness property. In addition, we present a general computational pipeline that employs any recognized algorithms for the Wasserstein barycenter in an iterative fashion and demonstrate its convergence. The utility of the Wasserstein median as a robust measure of central tendency is demonstrated using real and simulated data.",

    "abstract": "Deepfakes are one of the most recent developments in misinformation technology and are capable of superimposing one person's face onto another in video format. The potential of this technology to defame and cause harm is clear. However, despite the grave concerns expressed about deepfakes, these concerns are rarely accompanied with empirical evidence. We present a scoping review of the existing empirical studies that aim to investigate the effects of viewing deepfakes on people's beliefs, memories, and behaviour. Five databases were searched, producing an initial sample of 2004 papers, from which 22 relevant papers were identified, varying in methodology and research methods used. Overall, we found that the early studies on this topic have often produced inconclusive findings regarding the existence of uniquely persuasive or convincing effects of deepfake exposure. Moreover, many experiments demonstrated poor methodology and did not include a non-deepfake comparator (e.g., text-based misinformation). We conclude that speculation and scare mongering about dystopian uses of deepfake technologies has far outpaced experimental research that assess these harms. We close by offering insights on how to conduct improved empirical work in this area.",

    "abstract": "T cells play a central role in anti-tumor immunity, yet their function is often compromised within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, leading to cancer progression and resistance to immunotherapies. T-cell activation and differentiation require dynamic metabolic shifts, with mitochondrial metabolism playing a crucial role in sustaining their function. Research in cancer immunometabolism has revealed key mitochondrial abnormalities in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, including reduced mitochondrial capacity, depolarization, structural defects, and elevated reactive oxygen species. While these mitochondrial disruptions are well-characterized in solid tumors and linked to T-cell exhaustion, their impact on T-cell immunity in lymphoproliferative disorders remains underexplored. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most prevalent chronic adult leukemia, is marked by profound T-cell dysfunction that limits the success of adoptive cell therapies. Emerging studies are shedding light on the role of mitochondrial disturbances in CLL-related T-cell dysfunction, but significant knowledge gaps remain.

    "abstract": "Intravesical injections of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) are effective for treating refractory overactive bladder (OAB) in women. However, the adverse effects linked to the injections, such as hematuria, pain, and infection, and need for repeated injections can lower patient compliance and make the treatment inconvenient. Hence, urologists are actively pursuing less invasive and more convenient methods for the intravesical delivery of BTX-A. Advances in nanotechnology have facilitated noninvasive intravesical drug delivery. Currently, liposomes, hydrogels, nanoparticles, and many other forms of carriers can be used to enhance bladder wall permeability. This facilitates the entry of BTX-A into the bladder wall, allowing it to exert its effects. In this review, the feasibility and efficacy of liposomes, thermosensitive hydrogels, and hyaluronic acid-phosphatidylethanolamine for the treatment of OAB in women are discussed along with recent animal experiments on the use of nanotechnology-delivered BTX-A for the treatment of OAB in female rat models. Although the clinical efficacy of nanocarrier-encapsulated BTX-A for the treatment of OAB in women has not yet matched that of direct urethral muscle injection of BTX-A, improvements in certain symptoms indicate the potential of bladder instillation of nanocarrier-encapsulated BTX-A for future clinical applications. Consequently, further research on nanomaterials is warranted to advance the development of nanocarriers for the noninvasive delivery of BTX-A in the bladder.",

    "abstract": "Depression has become one of the most common mental disorders in the world. The rising incidence rate and disability rate pose a serious challenge to public health and socio-economic development. Traditional medication and psychotherapy are positive, but they often come with limitations such as side effects, poor compliance, and resource constraints, which highlights the urgent need for more proactive and sustainable non pharmacological interventions. We mainly explored the physiological and psychological mechanisms of exercise in alleviating depression in different age groups. In particular, we evaluated the characteristics and influencing factors of depression in each age group and compared the pathways through which exercise works, aiming to provide scientific basis for clinical practice and public health policies, and strengthen the application of non pharmacological treatment in depression management. It is worth noting that, in the context of a comprehensive search and analysis of recent literature, we have covered the epidemiology of depression, the impact of exercise on mental health, the characteristics of depression in different age groups, and the specific ways in which exercise alleviates depression through physiological and psychological mechanisms. Exercise alleviates symptoms of depression by regulating neurotransmitters, enhancing neuroplasticity, regulating hormone levels, reducing inflammatory responses through physiological pathways, as well as enhancing cognitive function, strengthening emotional regulation, triggering social interactions, and improving self-efficacy through psychological pathways. The differences in physiological and psychological mechanisms among different age groups determine the age dependent characteristics of exercise in mitigating depression. Teenagers, middle-aged people, and elderly people can improve depressive symptoms by enhancing neural progression, regulating stress responses, and strengthening social support, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis, a progressive and degenerative joint disease, disrupts the integrity of the entire joint structure, underscoring the urgency of identifying more effective therapeutic strategies and innovative targets. Among these, exercise therapy is considered a key component in the early management of osteoarthritis, functioning by stimulating the secretion of myokines from the skeletal muscle system. Irisin, a myokine predominantly secreted by skeletal muscle during exercise and encoded by the FNDC5 gene, has garnered attention for its regulatory effects on bone health. Emerging evidence suggests that irisin may play a protective role in osteoarthritis by promoting tissue homeostasis, enhancing subchondral bone density and microstructure, and inhibiting chondrocyte apoptosis. By improving chondrocyte viability, preserving extracellular matrix integrity, and maintaining homeostasis in osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes, irisin emerges as a promising therapeutic target for osteoarthritis. This review delves into the role of irisin in osteoarthritis pathogenesis, highlighting its influence on cartilage and bone metabolism as well as its dynamic relationship with exercise.

Previous pilot studies have demonstrated that dogs can effectively distinguish positive samples from negative samples in humans with breast cancer, achieving sensitivity rates as high as 100%. However, questions remain about dogs' ability to detect low concentrations of volatile organic compounds in complex medium. While dogs' detection thresholds for isoamyl acetate using a mineral oil substrate have been studied, there are no current studies on their detection limits using more complex substrates like urine, relevant in clinical settings. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the olfactory threshold of dogs using artificial urine with various concentrations of isoamyl acetate. Two dogs were trained to detect isoamyl acetate, initially using water as the substrate during the training phase, and subsequently using artificial urine during the testing phase, under single and double-blinded conditions. The dogs were trained to indicate the presence of isoamyl acetate solutions by sitting in front of the positive sample and ignoring controls.

Season had a significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) effect on the following sperm kinematics parameters: average path velocity, straight-line velocity, curve linear velocity, amplitude of lateral head displacement, and beat cross frequency. Semen characteristics were significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.01) improved in winter after 72 h of cold storage compared with those in summer. The summer season had a significant effect (<i>p</i> < 0.01) on seminal plasma antioxidant biomarkers (TAC, MDA, CAT, and GPx). Furthermore, the farrowing rate was significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) higher in the winter season. In conclusion, our results showed that the low MMP of boar sperm and the downregulation of seminal plasma antioxidant biomarkers in summer lead to poor semen quality and poor fertility in Hampshire-Ghungroo crossbred boars in a subtropical climate. To alleviate the heat-stress-induced poor sperm fertility in boars and to optimize the fertility of boars during summer in subtropics, there is a need for scientific interventions in terms of genetics [less exotic inheritance (below 50%)], nutrition, and management.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbiota with co-abundant behaviors is considered belonging to the same guild in micro-ecosystem. In this study, we established co-abundance networks of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) among 2944 Chinese adults from the Shanghai Men's and Women's Health Studies and observed a positive connection-dominated scale-free network using Sparse Correlations for Compositional data (SparCC). The closeness centrality was negatively correlated with other degree-based topological metrics in the network, indicating the isolated modularization of the bacteria. A total of 130 guilds were constructed, with a high modularity of 0.68, and retaining more diversity of OTUs than genus classification. The scores of guild structure similarity for comparisons between all, the healthy and the unhealthy subjects were higher than those derived from randomized permutations, suggesting a robust guild structure. We further used the constructed 130 guilds as the aggregation units to identify gut microbiota that may be associated with type 2 diabetes, and found that the OTUs in 21 significant guilds relevant to diabetes belonged to 19 of 41 (46.3%) previously reported genera (derived from Disbiome database), while only 10 (24.4%) showed different abundances between diabetes patients and healthy subjects in genus-based analysis.

The plant growth-promoting bacteria in the residue of PAD have the potential to enhance crop production, particularly during cold winter months. In this context, the characteristics of cultivable, cold-tolerant bacteria isolated from digestate obtained during PAD were investigated. Of the 20 isolates, 12 (60%) were able to solubilize phosphate from insoluble compounds at 15°C. Furthermore, nine (45%) and six (30%) isolates exhibited nitrogen fixation activity and produced indole acetic acid (IAA), respectively, while only two (10%) isolates were capable of producing siderophores. Hydrolytic enzyme production varied with cellulase production observed as a common trait since all isolates produced varying levels of cellulase ranging from 3.3 ± 0.5 to 15.3 ± 4 mm activity diameter. Isolates <i>Comamonas</i> sp._A3-1, <i>Acinetobacter iwoffi</i>_B5-1, and <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp._B5-5 displayed maximum cellulolytic activity with activity diameters of 13 ± 2, 13 ± 1.2, and 15.3 ± 4 mm, respectively.

    "abstract": "Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR) is a complex etiology disease that significantly impacts female fertility, endocrine function, and overall health status. In recent years, the incidence of DOR has been increasing, yet therapeutic methods remain relatively limited, particularly for patients with reproductive needs who often require Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) treatments. Growth Hormone (GH), a peptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary, promotes growth in bones, viscera, and multiple organs and systems throughout the body, enhances protein synthesis, and influences fat and mineral metabolism, playing a crucial role in human growth and development. Its levels decrease with the aging of the organism. In recent years, studies have suggested that a decline in growth hormone levels may be one of the causes of decreased ovarian function, leading to the application of GH in assisted reproductive treatments for patients with DOR. An increasing body of research indicates that GH can improve ovarian function through mechanisms such as antioxidant stress, promotion of follicle development, and enhancement of oocyte quality, and it also shows potential to improve endometrial receptivity, making GH a promising safe and effective strategy in ART for DOR patients.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic peripheral nerve injuries frequently result in irreversible functional deficits. While neurons possess an intrinsic capacity for axonal regeneration, the temporal constraints and the slow pace of neurite outgrowth often impede the complete restoration of sensory and motor capabilities. This impairment, often culminating in chronic disability, represents a significant clinical challenge, as there are currently no approved pharmacological interventions available to accelerate axon regeneration and improve functional recovery. This perspective focuses on recent scientific advancements that have identified sesquiterpene lactones, a family of naturally derived plant metabolites, as potential therapeutic candidates for treating peripheral nerve trauma. Preclinical investigations employing parthenolide and cnicin have revealed that these compounds can substantially augment axonal extension and functional recovery in diverse <i>in vivo</i> animal paradigms and primary human neuronal cultures. The favorable bioavailability of cnicin following oral administration, coupled with its notable tolerability at dosages considerably largely surpassing the therapeutic range, underscores its substantial potential as an effective pharmacological treatment for addressing the challenges associated with nerve regeneration and restoring sensory and motor functions.",

Cases of new-onset and relapsing vaccine-related glomerular diseases, including minimal change disease (MCD), antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, immunoglobulin (Ig)G4-related disease, and IgA nephropathy (IgAN), have been reported. Methods We present 30 patients who developed glomerular diseases after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. We evaluated the clinical characteristics, vaccine types, and outcomes of 30 patients whose urinalysis results indicated proteinuria and/or occult blood after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. For a definitive diagnosis, we performed a renal biopsy and evaluated their histological findings. Results Out of 30 patients, 19 (63.3%) were female, and 11 (36.7%) were male. The median age of the patient was 42.5 years (range, 24-66 years). Seventy-three percent of the patients received BioNTech Pfizer vaccines, and 26.7% received Moderna vaccines (mRNA-1273). Gross hematuria was observed in 83.3% of the patients, and 13.3% had nephrotic syndrome. Twenty patients with IgAN were diagnosed by renal biopsy, while the remaining were diagnosed with MCD (n=3), proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal Ig deposits (PGNMID) (n=1), TAFRO syndrome (characterized by thrombocytopenia, anasarca (edema, pleural effusion, and ascites), fever, reticulin fibrosis/renal dysfunction, and organomegaly; n=1), and anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease (n=1). Four patients who previously underwent treatment for IgAN experienced exacerbation of urinary abnormalities and disease relapse. Conclusion In conclusion, various glomerular diseases were newly diagnosed after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination.

    "abstract": "Hemp seed oil is a valuable source of unsaturated fatty acids. However, its high degree of unsaturation makes it highly susceptible to oxidation, which can compromise its quality and nutritional value. Enhancing its stability can be achieved by incorporating antioxidant compounds naturally present in the seeds. A deeper understanding of the interactions between the extraction process and the oil's composition would provide valuable insights for optimizing both its stability and bioactive properties. In this context, this study was aimed at investigating and optimizing the microwave-assisted extraction of hemp seed oil, enriched with bioactive compounds, using response surface methodology. Three extraction factors were investigated: microwave power (600, 750, and 900 W), cosolvent percentage (0%, 5%, and 10% ethanol relative to hexane), and extraction time (5, 10, and 15 min). Several responses were studied, including oil yield, total phenolic content (TPC), total tocopherols, oxidative stability index (OSI), chlorophylls, carotenoids, quality indices (peroxide value and conjugates [diene and triene]), and color (<i>L</i>∗, <i>a</i>∗, <i>b</i>∗, <i>C</i>∗⁣<sub>ab</sub>, and <i>h</i> <sub>ab</sub>). The optimum extraction conditions were 800 W, 7.5% EtOH, and 13.60 min, reaching a maximum yield of 30.69%.

Rapid advancements in the research scale and technological upgrades necessitate evaluating new methods to ensure reliability and precision in microbial community profiling. We systematically evaluated the performance of eight recent and commonly used extraction methods using a microbial mock community (MMC) and fecal samples from two healthy volunteers, incorporating bacterial, archaeal, and fungal constituents. Performance metrics included nucleic acid assessment, microbial profile assessment, and scalability for large-scale studies, leveraging shotgun metagenomics for in-depth analysis. Despite variations in DNA quantity and quality, all methods yielded sufficient DNA for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. In the MMC microbial profile assessment, the QIAamp PowerFecal pro Kit (PF) and DNeasy PowerSoil HTP kit (PS) methods exhibited higher similarity with the theoretical composition and lower variability across technical replicates compared to other methods. For fecal samples, the extraction method accounted for 21.4% of the overall microbiome variation and significantly affected the abundances of 32% of detected microbial species. Methods using mechanical lysis with small beads, such as PF and PS, demonstrated better efficiency, indicated by increased microbial diversity in extracting DNA from Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, the PF and PS methods are notably simple to execute and automation-friendly, though relatively costly.

    "abstract": "The effect of organic fertilizer substitution (OFS) on crop micronutrients often varies due to differences in environmental conditions, soil types, and nutrient status. This study aims to evaluate the effects of OFS on wheat grain micronutrients and bioavailability across five sites in Shandong Province from 2021 to 2022. All experimental sites included five common treatments: control, traditional farming, optimized practices, and 15 and 30% OFS for chemical nitrogen. The results revealed regional variation in wheat yield; the average wheat yield was 9.06 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>, and the highest yield was 9.58 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> in the 15%OF treatment. No significant differences in soil micronutrient availability were observed. Compared to the control, the OFS treatments exhibited significant increases in grain Fe (24.69%) and Zn (19.19%) contents. The OFS treatments significantly increased Fe and Zn bioavailability by reducing the PA/Fe and PA/Zn molar ratios. Organic fertilizer substitution also increased micronutrient nutritional yields and reduced the current health burden of Fe and Zn. Under the pessimistic scenario, the OFS treatment reduced health burdens of Zn and Fe deficiencies by 2.38 and 1.31%, respectively, whereas these mitigation efficiencies substantially increased to 7.15 and 3.94% under the optimistic scenario. In conclusion, OFS improved the content and bioavailability of Fe and Zn without affecting yield, which enhanced the nutritional quality of these nutrients, and alleviate the health burden of Fe and Zn deficiency.
