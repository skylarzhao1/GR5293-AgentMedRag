In recent years, because of the increased number of immigrants from East Asia in Western countries, hepatolithiasis has gradually become a global problem. Although current surgical interventions for hepatolithiasis boast a high rate of stone clearance, the persistent challenges of the disease's refractory nature and high recurrence rate continue to complicate its treatment. Therefore, understanding its underlying pathogenesis is meaningful for effective treatment. In this review, we discuss the common risk factors: infection, cholangitis, environmental factors and diet habits, abnormal bile components, anatomical abnormalities, and bile stasis, and summarize the relevant mechanisms.\")"

            "Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) differs from conventional antibiotics in its mechanism for combating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. SDT utilizes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during treatment, which causes multifaceted damage to bacterial cells. This approach reduces the likelihood of developing drug resistance, unlike conventional antibiotics, which can often lead to such resistance over time. Additionally, SDT offers superior tissue penetration compared to physical sterilization methods like ultraviolet irradiation, making it particularly effective for deep-seated infections, such as osteomyelitis. While SDT holds significant potential, its clinical application faces challenges related to translating this experimental strategy into standard practice.\n",

            "<b>Objectives:</b> Melancholic depression (MD) is a common subtype of major depressive disorder (MDD). It is difficult to treat because its neurobiological basis is poorly understood. Therefore, to investigate whether MD patients have any structural changes in gray matter (GM) and the molecular foundation of these changes, we combined voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis with neurotransmitter system-derived mapping from public data. <b>Methods:</b> 137 drug-naive MDD patients and 75 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited for structural magnetic resonance imaging. The imaging results were analyzed using VBM analysis. MDD patients were then divided into MD and nonmelancholic depression (NMD) subgroups according to their scores on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the... [truncated]\n",

            "Nickel clusters enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by activating and altering small molecules like H<sub>2</sub>, as demonstrated through density functional theory (DFT) studies. These clusters exhibit unique electronic structures and adsorption mechanisms that improve catalytic efficiency and stability. Their ability to facilitate HER makes them promising candidates for renewable energy conversion applications, particularly in the production of hydrogen fuel. By improving the efficiency of hydrogen generation, nickel clusters can contribute to the development of sustainable energy systems, such as fuel cells and other hydrogen-based technologies, which are crucial for reducing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering carbon emissions.\n",

To examine the catalytic efficiency of nickel clusters in different applications, this Review combines experimental techniques with density functional theory (DFT). Researchers have shown that nickel clusters can activate and alter tiny molecules like CO, NO, and H<sub>2</sub> through DFT studies that delve deeply into their electronic structures, adsorption mechanisms, and stability. These findings lay the groundwork for the development of effective catalysts for various processes.

Oxo clusters have a higher surface-to-volume ratio than nanocrystals, rendering them more active. For large substrates, for example, oleic acid, MOF UiO-66 has negligible catalytic activity while clusters provide almost quantitative conversion, a fact we ascribe to limited diffusion of large substrates through the MOF pores. Clusters do not suffer from limited mass transfer and we also obtain high conversion in solvent-free reactions with sterically hindered alcohols (hexanol, 2-ethyl hexanol, benzyl alcohol, and neopentyl alcohol).
