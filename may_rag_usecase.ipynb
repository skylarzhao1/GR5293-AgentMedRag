In recent years, because of the increased number of immigrants from East Asia in Western countries, hepatolithiasis has gradually become a global problem. Although current surgical interventions for hepatolithiasis boast a high rate of stone clearance, the persistent challenges of the disease's refractory nature and high recurrence rate continue to complicate its treatment. Therefore, understanding its underlying pathogenesis is meaningful for effective treatment. In this review, we discuss the common risk factors: infection, cholangitis, environmental factors and diet habits, abnormal bile components, anatomical abnormalities, and bile stasis, and summarize the relevant mechanisms.\")"

This review provides an in-depth analysis of various nanochaperones developed to target AβOs, detailing their mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential via focusing on two main strategies, namely, disruption of AβOs through direct interaction and the inhibition of AβO nucleation by binding to intermediates of the oligomerization process. Evidence from in vivo studies indicate that NMs hold promise for ameliorating AD symptoms. Additionally, the review explores the different interaction mechanisms through which nanoparticles exhibit their inhibitory effects on AβOs, providing insights into their potential for clinical application.
