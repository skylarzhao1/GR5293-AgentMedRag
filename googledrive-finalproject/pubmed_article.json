Gaining mechanistic insights into the regulation and biological function of calprotectin will help facilitate patient diagnostics and therapy for inflammation and further our understanding of the host-microbe interface. Recent literature has identified zebrafish s100a10b as zebrafish calprotectin based on sequence similarity, genomic context, and transcriptional upregulation during the immune response to bacterial infections. The field would benefit from expanding the breadth of calprotectin studies into a zebrafish innate immunity model. Here, we carefully evaluated the possibility that zebrafish possess a calprotectin ortholog or a paralog that convergently evolved similar function. Using careful bioinformatics approaches, we found that zebrafish do not have an ortholog of either mammalian S100A8 or S100A9. To look for paralogs with convergent function, we identified four zebrafish s100 proteins-including s100a10b-that are expressed in immune cells and upregulated during the immune response. We recombinantly expressed and purified these proteins and measured their antimicrobial activity. None of the zebrafish proteins exhibited activity comparable to mammalian calprotectin. We also generated structural models of all homodimers and heterodimers of all annotated zebrafish s100 genes. None of these complexes were predicted to have an antimicrobial transition metal binding site equivalent to calprotectin. Finally, we measured the ability of our four purified zebrafish s100 proteins to activate inflammation via Toll-like receptor 4, a key feature of human S100A9; none of the proteins activated the receptor.

Following IS, the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier is compromised, leading to increased intestinal permeability. The gut microbiota can translocate to other organs, triggering systemic immune responses that inhibit recovery after IS. Moreover, the composition and proportion of the gut microbiota change after IS. The number of beneficial bacteria decreases, whereas the number of harmful bacteria increases. The production of beneficial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), is reduced, and the levels of harmful metabolites, such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), increase. Antibiotics after IS not only help prevent infection but also have neuroprotective effects. Although poststroke reperfusion therapy can effectively restore cerebral blood flow, it may also cause intestinal mucosal damage and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Nutritional support after IS can alter the gut microbiota structure and promote neurological recovery. Therefore, individualized treatment for IS patients is crucial. In summary, IS affects not only the brain but the entire body system, especially the gut. Intestinal damage and dysbiosis are critical in IS occurrence, development, and prognosis. By protecting the intestinal mucosa and modulating the structure of the gut microbiota, intestinal damage and related infections can be reduced, improving patient prognosis.

Using PubMed and Google Scholar, our search focused on articles published from 2004 onwards, utilizing search terms \"Placenta Accreta Spectrum\" OR \"Adherent Placenta\" and \"Caesarean Delivery\". The selection for review adhered to specified inclusion/exclusion criteria and finally focused on 50 articles. It was found that published work includes the following conservative approaches: first, to leave the placenta expecting autolysis and resolution; second, to leave the placenta with the intention of a delayed hysterectomy; and third, to resort to an intraoperative arterial occlusion and follow-up. Though the primary objective of reducing blood loss at initial surgery is usually achieved, the success of uterine preservation differs. The availability of a multidisciplinary team for the surgical management of PAS is an important factor to consider. Limiting the extent of surgery at the time of CD, combined with or without arterial embolization/ballooning/ligation, reduces blood loss and limits morbidity with the potential to preserve the uterus.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "03", "day": "31"}}, {"article_title": "Dendritic cells in multiple myeloma: from immune evasion to therapeutic potential.", "article_abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of hematologic cancer characterized by the uncontrolled clonal expansion of plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). This leads to significant dysfunction and suppression of the immune system in affected patients. Myeloma cells employ sophisticated strategies to manipulate immune and non-immune cells, evading immune surveillance and enhancing their survival. One key factor in this evasion is the disruption of dendritic cell (DC)-mediated immune mechanisms. Extensive evidence indicates that in the presence of myeloma cells, DC numbers are notably reduced, and their phenotype and function are altered, impairing their ability to present antigens and activate robust T-cell responses effectively. Despite rapid advances in MM treatment, with promising strategies such as DC-based vaccines being already achieved, DC dysfunction remains a substantial hurdle, associated with or contributing to poor therapeutic outcomes, disease relapse, and MM's persistence as an incurable disease. To address these challenges, it is essential to understand the intricate mechanisms through which myeloma cells transform DCs into their \"accomplices,\" undermining immune responses. This review comprehensively summarizes the current understanding of the role of DCs in MM. Additionally, it evaluates the potential of DCs in anti-MM immunotherapy, discussing persistent challenges and highlighting emerging perspectives that may lead to promising breakthroughs for improved patient outcomes.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "17"}}, {"article_title": "Role and Mechanism of Olfactory Stem Cells in the Treatment of Olfactory Disorders.", "article_abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction is one of the most prevalent diseases in otorhinolaryngology, particularly since the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with a potential impact on daily life.

This review examines the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying LCS, with a particular focus on autophagy inhibition, chronic inflammation, oxidative, nitrosative and calcium stress, viral persistence and autoimmunology. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms involved in LCS include (1) autoimmune activation, (2) latent viral persistence, where SARS-CoV-2 continues to influence host metabolism, (3) reactivation of latent pathogens such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV), exacerbating immune and metabolic dysregulation, and (4) possible persistent metabolic and inflammatory dysregulation, where the body fails to restore post-infection homeostasis. The manipulation of cellular pathways by SARS-CoV-2 proteins is a critical aspect of the virus' ability to evade immune clearance and establish long-term dysfunction. Viral proteins such as NSP13, ORF3a and ORF8 have been shown to disrupt autophagy, thereby impairing viral clearance and promoting immune evasion. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulated calcium signaling, oxidative stress, chronic HIF-1\u03b1 activation and Nrf2 inhibition create a self-sustaining inflammatory feedback loop that contributes to tissue damage and persistent symptoms. Therefore understanding the molecular basis of LCS is critical for the development of effective therapeutic strategies.

Among these, exercise therapy is considered a key component in the early management of osteoarthritis, functioning by stimulating the secretion of myokines from the skeletal muscle system. Irisin, a myokine predominantly secreted by skeletal muscle during exercise and encoded by the FNDC5 gene, has garnered attention for its regulatory effects on bone health. Emerging evidence suggests that irisin may play a protective role in osteoarthritis by promoting tissue homeostasis, enhancing subchondral bone density and microstructure, and inhibiting chondrocyte apoptosis. By improving chondrocyte viability, preserving extracellular matrix integrity, and maintaining homeostasis in osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes, irisin emerges as a promising therapeutic target for osteoarthritis.

While dogs' detection thresholds for isoamyl acetate using a mineral oil substrate have been studied, there are no current studies on their detection limits using more complex substrates like urine, relevant in clinical settings. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the olfactory threshold of dogs using artificial urine with various concentrations of isoamyl acetate. Two dogs were trained to detect isoamyl acetate, initially using water as the substrate during the training phase, and subsequently using artificial urine during the testing phase, under single and double-blinded conditions.

A total of 14 Hampshire-Ghungroo crossbred boars were used for this investigation, which took place in both summer and winter. Sperm characteristics, namely motility, viability, abnormality, acrosomal integrity, and the hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST) results, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were evaluated. Sperm kinematics parameters were assessed using computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA). Antioxidant biomarkers (glutathione peroxidase, GPx; catalase, CAT; and total antioxidant capacity, TAC) and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, MDA) were analyzed in boars' seminal plasma. The summer season had a significant (<i>p</i>\u202f<\u202f0.01) negative impact on reaction time and false mounts, whereas semen volume and sperm concentration were significantly (<i>p</i>\u202f<\u202f0.01) higher in the winter season. Similarly, sperm abnormalities were significantly (<i>p</i>\u202f<\u202f0.01) lower in the winter season. In the winter, sperm quality parameters, namely total motility, progressive motility, viability, acrosomal integrity, and HOST reactivity, were significantly (<i>p</i>\u202f<\u202f0.01) improved. However, during the summer, sperm MMP was significantly (<i>p</i>\u202f<\u202f0.01) lower in fresh samples and after 72\u202fh of storage. Season had a significant (<i>p</i>\u202f<\u202f0.05) effect on the following sperm kinematics parameters: average path velocity, straight-line velocity, curve linear velocity, amplitude of lateral head displacement, and beat cross frequency. Semen characteristics were significantly (<i>p</i>\u202f<\u202f0.01) improved in winter after 72\u202fh of cold storage compared with those in summer. The summer season had a significant effect (<i>p</i>\u202f<\u202f0.01) on seminal plasma antioxidant biomarkers (TAC, MDA, CAT, and GPx).

Cases of new-onset and relapsing vaccine-related glomerular diseases, including minimal change disease (MCD), antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, immunoglobulin (Ig)G4-related disease, and IgA nephropathy (IgAN), have been reported. Methods We present 30 patients who developed glomerular diseases after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. We evaluated the clinical characteristics, vaccine types, and outcomes of 30 patients whose urinalysis results indicated proteinuria and/or occult blood after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. For a definitive diagnosis, we performed a renal biopsy and evaluated their histological findings. Results Out of 30 patients, 19 (63.3%) were female, and 11 (36.7%) were male. The median age of the patient was 42.5 years (range, 24-66 years). Seventy-three percent of the patients received BioNTech Pfizer vaccines, and 26.7% received Moderna vaccines (mRNA-1273). Gross hematuria was observed in 83.3% of the patients, and 13.3% had nephrotic syndrome. Twenty patients with IgAN were diagnosed by renal biopsy, while the remaining were diagnosed with MCD (n=3), proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal Ig deposits (PGNMID) (n=1), TAFRO syndrome (characterized by thrombocytopenia, anasarca (edema, pleural effusion, and ascites), fever, reticulin fibrosis/renal dysfunction, and organomegaly; n=1), and anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease (n=1).

In this context, this study was aimed at investigating and optimizing the microwave-assisted extraction of hemp seed oil, enriched with bioactive compounds, using response surface methodology. Three extraction factors were investigated: microwave power (600, 750, and 900\u2009W), cosolvent percentage (0%, 5%, and 10% ethanol relative to hexane), and extraction time (5, 10, and 15\u2009min).

Performance metrics included nucleic acid assessment, microbial profile assessment, and scalability for large-scale studies, leveraging shotgun metagenomics for in-depth analysis. Despite variations in DNA quantity and quality, all methods yielded sufficient DNA for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. In the MMC microbial profile assessment, the QIAamp PowerFecal pro Kit (PF) and DNeasy PowerSoil HTP kit (PS) methods exhibited higher similarity with the theoretical composition and lower variability across technical replicates compared to other methods. For fecal samples, the extraction method accounted for 21.4% of the overall microbiome variation and significantly affected the abundances of 32% of detected microbial species. Methods using mechanical lysis with small beads, such as PF and PS, demonstrated better efficiency, indicated by increased microbial diversity in extracting DNA from Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, the PF and PS methods are notably simple to execute and automation-friendly, though relatively costly.

This study aims to evaluate the effects of OFS on wheat grain micronutrients and bioavailability across five sites in Shandong Province from 2021 to 2022. All experimental sites included five common treatments: control, traditional farming, optimized practices, and 15 and 30% OFS for chemical nitrogen. The results revealed regional variation in wheat yield; the average wheat yield was 9.06\u202fMg\u202fha<sup>-1</sup>, and the highest yield was 9.58\u202fMg\u202fha<sup>-1</sup> in the 15%OF treatment. No significant differences in soil micronutrient availability were observed. Compared to the control, the OFS treatments exhibited significant increases in grain Fe (24.69%) and Zn (19.19%) contents. The OFS treatments significantly increased Fe and Zn bioavailability by reducing the PA/Fe and PA/Zn molar ratios. Organic fertilizer substitution also increased micronutrient nutritional yields and reduced the current health burden of Fe and Zn. Under the pessimistic scenario, the OFS treatment reduced health burdens of Zn and Fe deficiencies by 2.38 and 1.31%, respectively, whereas these mitigation efficiencies substantially increased to 7.15 and 3.94% under the optimistic scenario. In conclusion, OFS improved the content and bioavailability of Fe and Zn without affecting yield, which enhanced the nutritional quality of these nutrients, and alleviate the health burden of Fe and Zn deficiency. The findings demonstrate that a 15% organic fertilizer substitution (OFS) optimally enhances wheat grain Fe and Zn bioavailability and nutritional quality while maintaining crop yield, offering region-specific evidence for sustainable agricultural practices to mitigate micronutrient deficiencies and improve human health outcomes.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "17"}}, {"article_title": "Critical contributions of neuronal subtypes to pediatric drug-resistant focal dysplasia.", "article_abstract": "Approximately 75% of epilepsy cases emerge in childhood, and 10%-30% of these pediatric epilepsy cases are resistant to standard drug therapies; however, the underlying causes of resistance remain poorly understood. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a primary contributor to pediatric epilepsy and is often associated with drug resistance. We performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and patch-clamp recording of fresh brain tissue samples that were obtained from pediatric FCD patients during surgery. Our study revealed significant transcriptomic changes across multiple subtypes of excitatory neurons and GABAergic neurons. Among the identified neuronal subtypes, the three inhibitory neuronal subtypes PVALB_RGS5, VIP_CRH, and SST_PENK presented prominent transcriptomic alterations related to epilepsy. The expression of genes enriched in epilepsy-related signaling pathways, especially those associated with excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance and energy metabolism, was significantly altered in these neuronal subtypes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the PVALB_RGS5 subtype were particularly enriched in pathways related to synaptic function. Recordings from fast-spiking (FS)/parvalbumin-containing neurons in brain sections from patients with FCD revealed a reduction in excitatory synaptic inputs, which indicates fewer synaptic inputs onto these neurons and lower activity. In addition, astrocyte subtype 4 exhibited distinct metabolic characteristics and interaction patterns with neuronal subtypes, which suggests their significant role in epilepsy pathophysiology.

Hottois starts from a metaphilosophy of language that diagnoses twentieth-century philosophy as fixated on language at the expense of technology. As an alternative, he developed a philosophy of technoscience that reinterprets science as primarily an intervening and technical activity rather than a contemplative and theoretical one. As I will argue, Hottois articulates the nature of this technicity through a philosophy of time, reflecting on the specific temporality of technoscience as distinct from human history. This temporality of technoscience provoked the need for ethical reflection, since technoscience is constantly changing and transforming the world. This led to Hottois's engagement with bioethics, in which he sought to develop a framework capable of \"guiding\" technoscience. Aiming to avoid both total symbolic closure and total technical openness, this guidance is concerned with the preservation of diversity, especially the human capacity for ethics, ethicity. This idea of guidance was later taken up by Dutch philosophers such as Hans Achterhuis and Peter-Paul Verbeek, inspiring their empirical turn in the philosophy of technology.

To address this issue, we developed a novel approach using \u00c5ngstrom-scale silver particles (Ag\u00c5Ps) with broad-spectrum antibacterial properties. Specifically, we formulated a polyethylene glycol hydrogel infused with Ag\u00c5Ps (Gel-Ag\u00c5Ps) designed for treating fracture fixation infections. This novel hydrogel formulation is injectable, ensuring precise adherence to both the exposed tissue and fracture surfaces, thereby allowing the direct targeted action of Ag\u00c5Ps at the infection site. The Gel-Ag\u00c5Ps significantly reduced the infection caused by Escherichia coli (a model pathogen of orthopedic implant infection) in a murine femoral fracture model. Moreover, the Gel-Ag\u00c5Ps-treated infected fractures healed completely within 6 weeks, exhibiting bone formation and mechanical strength comparable to those of uninfected fractures. Further analysis revealed a significant downregulation of local inflammatory response as evidenced by a lower expression of inflammatory markers in Gel-Ag\u00c5Ps-treated fractures compared to untreated infected controls. Furthermore, Gel-Ag\u00c5Ps exhibited a unique ability to inhibit osteoclast differentiation, a critical factor in infection-induced bone degradation, without impacting osteoblast activity. In conclusion, Gel-Ag\u00c5Ps exerted a dual therapeutic effect by eradicating bacterial infection and mitigating inflammation-induced osteoclast activity, thereby expediting infected fracture healing.

The genus Lanius, known for its distinctive pigmentation patterns, shows considerable variability within species, making it an intriguing but poorly understood group. We applied Explainable AI (XAI) methods to uncover pigmentation patterns that represent species-wide identification signatures. To do this, we used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify shrike eggs and explore potential correlations between egg identification and eggshell patterns. Our CNN model achieved over 95% accuracy in predicting species, but identifying specific discriminative features proved difficult, as the model only highlighted general trends. This method could help organize collections and verify species affiliation in global ornithological collections, which often face challenges such as missing or illegible labels. CNNs can enhance species identification and improve the accuracy of ornithological studies. Despite some challenges, the potential applications of this research in avian biology and museum collections are promising.

The run time sensorial data is interfaced, processed and recorded using Robot Operating System (ROS). The live laser scan is utilized for the pose estimation using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technique. In absence of valid SLAM estimation and frequent GPS outages, a multimodal sensor fusion framework for the enhanced pose correction has been developed using Kalman Filter (KF) by incorporating the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and wheel odometric data along with SLAM and GPS data. The corrected pose is utilized for the 3D point cloud mapping by incorporating laser scans perceived periodically from various 2D laser scanners mounted on the MMS. The custom-made installation scheme has been followed for mounting three 2D laser scanners at horizontal, vertical and inclined orientations. The efficacy of the developed map has employed for extraction of road edges and associated road assets by establishing the lucrative classification technique of the point cloud using Split and Merge segmentation and Hough transformation.

Twelve feature selection methods including correlation-based techniques, mutual information-based methods, and embedded techniques were utilized to rank the top genes as features, through this approach, multiple feature selection methods were combined to yield more robust features important in this disease progression. Cox regression-based survival analysis was carried out to evaluate the biomarker potentiality of these genes. Furthermore, multiphase drug repurposing strategy and molecular docking were employed to identify potential drug candidates against these biomarkers. Among the seven machine learning models initially evaluated, DISCR resulted as the most accurate disease stage classifier. Ensemble feature selection identified ten top genes, among which eight were recognized as potential biomarkers based on survival analysis. These include genes ABAT, ABCB11, MBTPS1, and ZFP1 mostly involved in alanine and glutamate metabolism, butanoate metabolism, and ER protein processing. Through drug repurposing, 81 candidate drugs were found to be effective against these markers genes, with Diosmin, Esculin, Lapatinib, and Phenelzine as the best candidates screened through molecular docking and MMGBSA. The consensus derived from multiple methods enhances the accuracy of identifying relevant robust biomarkers for NAFLD-associated HCC. The use of these biomarkers in a multiphase drug repurposing strategy highlights potential therapeutic options for early intervention, which is essential to stop disease progression and improve outcomes.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "17"}}, {"article_title": "Cardamonin suppresses mTORC1/SREBP1 through reducing Raptor and inhibits de novo lipogenesis in ovarian cancer.", "article_abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer and de novo lipogenesis (DNL) accelerates the progression of ovarian cancer. In this study, we investigated the effects of cardamonin, a natural compound potential to suppress various malignancies, on the lipid anabolism in ovarian cancer. Cell proliferation was assessed using CCK-8 and clone formation assay. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was measured with JC-10 probe. Free fatty acids (FFA) was measured by fluorescence using acyl-CoA oxidation and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1) activity was analyzed by spectrophotometric assay using palmitoyl-CoA and DTNB (5,5'-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) reaction. mRNA expression was measured by Quantitative Real-Time PCR. Protein expression was analyzed through western blotting and immunofluorescence. Raptor was knocked down by shRNA and Raptor was overexpressed by lentiviral transfection. The antitumor effect of cardamonin was evaluated using a xenotransplantation tumor bearing mouse model. Cardamonin suppressed the cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis and triggered mitochondrial damage in ovarian cancer cells. Cardamonin inhibited the protein expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and its downstream lipogenic enzymes and decreased FFA content and CPT-1 activity. Additionally, cardamonin inhibited the activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and expression of regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor). Raptor knockdown abolished the inhibitory effect of cardamonin on mTORC1 and SREBP1. Furthermore, cardamonin inhibited mTORC1 activation and lipogenic proteins expression induced by Raptor overexpression. Cardamonin reduced the tumor growth and fatty acid synthase of the tumors, as evidenced by decreased expression of Ki-67 and FASN. It suggests that cardamonin suppresses mTORC1/SREBP1 through reducing the protein level of Raptor and inhibits DNL of ovarian cancer.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "05", "day": "02"}}, {"article_title": "ALDOC promotes neuroblastoma progression and modulates sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs by enhancing aerobic glycolysis.", "article_abstract": "Neuroblastoma (NB), a malignant extracranial solid tumor originating from the sympathetic nervous system, exhibits poor prognosis in high-risk cases, with a 5-year overall survival rate below 50%.

What little research suggests that COVID-19 had a negative effect on neurobehavioral symptoms and that this effect was worse for individuals who were younger, had lower education, or other chronic conditions.ObjectiveThe purpose of the current study was to examine the change (before, during, and after) in neurobehavioral symptoms for a sample of Colombian children who tested positive for COVID-19 and to identify key predictors of post-COVID neurobehavioral impairments.MethodsThe Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory was administered to caregivers (92.90% female) of 85 children (51.80% female) by researchers in Colombia. Data was collected after the child had recovered from COVID-19 with retrospective questions about the child's function before and during COVID-19, as well as at the time of data collection.ResultsAt the domain level, caregivers reported large increases in children's somatic symptoms, a medium increase in affective symptoms, and a small increase in cognitive symptoms before vs. during COVID-19. Caregivers also noted a large increase in children's somatic symptoms, a medium increase in affective symptoms, and a small increase in cognitive symptoms before vs after COVID-19. The somatic symptom domain was the only category to see an improvement following infection (during vs after). Three separate linear regressions indicated that greater COVID-19 severity during the infection significantly predicted greater current (after COVID-19) somatic symptom severity, and the presence of a pre-existing respiratory disease significantly predicted greater current cognitive and affective symptom severity.ConclusionThis study highlights the importance of evaluating and treating neurobehavioral symptoms post-COVID-19 among children in Colombia and identifies this need in an underserved and under-researched population.

P2RX7 is a non-selective cationic transmembrane purinergic receptor activated by elevated levels of extracellular ATP, which typically occurs during inflammatory conditions. Activation of P2RX7 by \u03b1Syn is implicated in neuronal degeneration, potentially causing pore dilation and increased inflammation. By integrating the data curation, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, along with structural analyses, we attempted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and binding sites for P2RX7-\u03b1Syn interaction. We elucidated interactions between P2RX7 and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of \u03b1Syn. Utilizing cryo-EM structures of P2RX7 in ATP-bound and unbound states, we assessed \u03b1Syn's effect on P2RX7 structural and functional dynamics. Initially, the analyses revealed that \u03b1Syn interactomes are mainly involved in mitochondrial functions, while P2RX7 interactors are linked to receptor internalization and calcium transport. Molecular docking with six tools identified that \u03b1Syn-NTD fragments preferentially bind to the proximal region of P2RX7's transmembrane domain. Microsecond all atom MD simulations in a POPS lipid bilayer showed significant atomic fluctuations, particularly in the head region, lower body, and large loop of P2RX7's cytoplasmic domain. Secondary structure analysis indicated unfolding in regions related to pore dilation and receptor desensitization. Further by contact-based and solvent accessibility analyses, along with protein structure network (PSN) studies, we identified crucial residues involved in \u03b1Syn-P2RX7 interactions.

The EMG signals of 6 muscles from 10 subjects during lateral walking were collected. Four gait phases were recognized, and the hip angles of both legs were continuously estimated.

LCC and ChlF parameters (NPQ, Fv'/Fm', ETR, ETRmax, Fm', qL, qP, Y(II) were measured alongside leaf hyperspectral reflectance from <i>Rhamnus leptophylla</i> suffering from constant drought during water stress. Water stress caused NPQ, Fv'/Fm', ETRmax, Fm', qL, qP, Y(II) and ETR continuous decline throughout the entire drought period. ChlF was more sensitive to drought monitoring than LCC. The original reflectance spectra and hyperspectral vegetation indices (SVIs) showed a strong correlation with LCC and ChlF. Reflectance in 540-560nm and 750-1100nm and selected SVI such as Simple Ratio (SR)752/690 can track drought responses effectively before leaves showed drought symptoms. Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR) and three machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were employed to develop models for estimating LCC and ChlF parameters.

Despite the adoption of sustainability principles by the higher education sector, the translation into nursing curriculum has been challenging. The increased integration of digital technologies in health contributes towards both sustainability in health and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Electronic health records (EHRs) are well documented in reducing the reliance on paper-based records and improve the efficiency of health delivery, including accessibility to health where information sharing barriers are reduced. The incorporation of digital health training, and specifically the use of simulated EHRs, into nursing curriculum will increase the application of the principles of planetary health into graduate practice. <b>Aims:</b> This study explored if the use of an EHR in a simulated learning environment (SLE) in a Bachelor of Nursing (BN) program can lead to tangible reduction in paper consumption. <b>Methods:</b> A nonexperimental, pre- and postdesign was used to audit the paper consumption, specifically paper-based manuals, within the SLE pre- and postimplementation of the HealthiERSim\u00ae, an in house developed simulated EHR system.

In this article, I consider both the potential for methodology to produce temporal violence as well as the potential of Mad Time to disrupt normative and often sanist research practices. To achieve this, I weave together theorizing on Mad Time, post-qualitative inquiry, the experiences of peer support workers, and my own temporal conflicts in attempting to madden research within academia. I propose three ways in which Mad Time may provoke alternative methodological practices that move us closer to epistemic justice: rethinking the concept of data, embracing stumbling, circling, scrambling (becoming), and valuing variations in pace.

The amount of available energy is determined by the mechanical energy budget of the atmospheric boundary layer and is found to be a function of C/A, where C is the circumference and A is the area of the wind farm. The actual power production of 31 wind farms is analyzed, and the power production in 23 of the largest wind farms follows the same functional form as the available energy, indicating that the power production in these wind farms is limited by the available energy. The power density in the North Sea, as a function of the area usage, is found by fitting the actual power density of existing wind farms to the expression for available energy in the atmospheric boundary layer. Wind farms below 10 km2 can produce more than 6 Wm-2, but the power density rapidly decreases with area. Wind farms with an area of about 1000 km2 will produce [Formula: see text] 1 Wm-2, and power densities will asymptotically approach a value of 0.78 [Formula: see text] 0.58 Wm-2 for increasing wind farm area.

Currently, the causal mechanisms and critical time thresholds remain poorly defined across the different molecular subtypes of breast cancer. We investigated the relationship between diagnostic delays and breast cancer outcomes based on the data from our center, with a focus on identifying actionable intervention points within the diagnostic pathway. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 802 breast cancer patients treated at King Fahad Specialist Hospital in Qassim Province, Saudi Arabia (2017-2024). Using directed acyclic graphs and mediation analysis, we quantified the causal pathways through which delays impact the outcomes. Markov chain modeling was utilized to determine the molecular subtype-specific critical thresholds where stage migration probability exceeds 10%. Results We found that 589 patients (73.5%) experienced high-risk delays (over two months). Stage migration emerged as the primary mediator, accounting for 67.3% (95% CI: 58.4-76.1%) of the total effect of delays on survival. We have identified multiple critical thresholds across molecular subtypes: 38 days for triple-negative, 52 days for HER2-positive, and 85 days for ER+/PR+/HER2- tumors. Hazard ratios for mortality increased progressively with delay duration, from 1.18 (95% CI: 1.05-1.32) for delays of two weeks to one month to 2.35 (95% CI: 2.06-2.67) for delays that are equal to or more than one year, translating to an average 3.40 life years lost per patient. Conclusions The impact of diagnostic delays on breast cancer outcomes is fundamentally governed by tumor biology, with significant vulnerability thresholds aligned with molecular aggressiveness. Our findings support applying a biologically informed triage system where molecular characteristics determine maximum acceptable diagnostic intervals.

Operating outside formal regulations, these groups offer flexible and innovative care; documenting their practices is crucial for evaluating service quality. This paper presents a protocol of an international, informal Psychological First Aid (PFA) telephone-based initiative and a reflective account from a volunteering therapist. The initiative aimed to support Ukrainian civilians affected by the Russian-Ukrainian war through crisis intervention and resilience-building. Guided by PFA principles, theoretical first aid models, and evidence-based practices, the telephone interventions focused on reducing distress, providing moral support, and restoring functioning. A Russian-speaking therapist assisted 34 Ukrainian civilians, primarily addressing acute stress, anxiety, and panic attacks. Using an autoethnographic approach, this study integrates the therapist's retrospective reflections, cultural context, and professional learning to examine PFA implementation in a crisis setting. Individuals who received telephone-based PFA reported decreased distress and enhanced coping strategies, suggesting effectiveness. The initiative's three-year continuation illustrates its sustainability. The therapist's reflections highlight the importance of professional preparation, shared linguistic and cultural backgrounds, and a sense of purpose in delivering effective support. While limitations include the absence of standardized measures and potential self-selection and volunteer biases, this study demonstrates the feasibility of providing remote psychological first aid to civilians through informal international groups. Critically evaluating practices adopted by these informal organizations is essential for understanding their effectiveness, improving future implementation, and co-creating best practices for crisis intervention and support services that embrace \"Care Without Address\" models.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "14"}}, {"article_title": "Establishment of a set of St-group wheat-<i>Thinopyrum ponticum</i> derivative lines conferring resistance to powdery mildew.", "article_abstract": "<i>Thinopyrum ponticum</i> (2<i>n</i> = 10<i>x</i> = 70, E<sup>e</sup>E<sup>e</sup>E<sup>b</sup>E<sup>b</sup>E<sup>x</sup>E<sup>x</sup>StStStSt), a wild relative of common wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L., 2<i>n</i> = 6<i>x</i> = 42), possesses extensive genetic diversity.

The ubiquitin-proteasome system, particularly E3 ubiquitin ligases, may play a pivotal role in modulating these processes. FBXO38, an E3 ligase involved in proteasomal degradation, has been implicated in various physiological pathways, but its role in regulating oxidative stress in endothelial cells is unknown. We hypothesized that FBXO38 mitigates endothelial damage induced by low oscillatory shear stress (LOSS) by promoting the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation of Nox1, a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using an in vitro LOSS model in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and an in vivo mouse partial carotid ligation model, we assessed the expression of FBXO38 and Nox1 through quantitative PCR, western blotting, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. LOSS significantly reduced FBXO38 protein expression (by ~60%, <i>p</i> < 0.0001 at 24\u2009h), leading to increased Nox1 protein levels (approximately two-fold, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and apoptosis. FBXO38 overexpression markedly attenuated Nox1 accumulation (~50% reduction, <i>p</i> < 0.05), reduced ROS production, and improved cell viability under LOSS conditions, whereas FBXO38 knockdown exacerbated these effects. Moreover, FBXO38 directly interacted with Nox1, suggesting a ubiquitin-dependent degradation mechanism.

The WinterPeachNet model achieves a comprehensive improvement in network performance by integrating depthwise separable inverted bottleneck ResNet (DIBResNet), bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) structure, GhostConv module, and the YOLOv11 detection head (v11detect). The DIBResNet module, based on the ResNet architecture, introduces an inverted bottleneck structure and depthwise separable convolution technology, enhancing the depth and quality of feature extraction while effectively reducing the model's computational complexity. The GhostConv module further improves detection accuracy by reducing the number of convolution kernels. Additionally, the BiFPN structure strengthens the model's ability to detect objects of different sizes by fusing multi-scale feature information.

The disease is more frequently observed in tropical countries such as Brazil. Important studies have been shown a predominantly cell-mediated immune response during chromoblastomycosis. Results from our laboratory showed that Th1 responses are essential to induce protection during chromoblastomycosis. IL-18 is primarily produced by macrophages and is known to induce the production of IFN\u03b3, a cytokine associated with Th1 cell activation. Once produced, IL-18 acts to promote Th1 cell differentiation and activation. Th1 cells, in turn, secrete cytokines such as IFN\u03b3, which are critical for the elimination of intracellular pathogens, including fungi. IFN\u03b3 enhances the fungicidal activity of macrophages, promotes the development of antifungal effector mechanisms, and contributes to the containment of fungal growth. Our results indicate that F. pedrosoi is sensed by the NLRP3 inflammasome, which induces caspase-1 activation and production of IL-18.

Rectal thermometry is the most common method for determining the temperatures of adult horses and foals. However, this method requires restraining the animals for several seconds, and it poses potential risks to both horses and humans. This study compared infrared and rectal thermometry in 126 horses, evaluating age and measurement site influences on body temperature. Horses were divided into three groups: foals (4-12\u202fmonths), Shetland ponies (8-12\u202fmonths), and adult horses (2-30\u202fyears). Rectal, ocular, gingival, and perineal temperatures were recorded to assess the potential of non-invasive infrared methods. Reference intervals of temperature at different body sites are provided. No significant differences were found in gingival and perineal temperatures among groups. Foals showed significantly higher rectal temperatures than adults (<i>p</i> <\u202f0.001), likely due to age. Shetland ponies showed higher ocular temperatures than foals and adult horses (<i>p</i> <\u202f0.05, <i>p</i> <\u202f0.001), probably because they were influenced by ambient temperature, which significantly correlated with ocular readings. Significant positive correlations existed between ocular and rectal (<i>p</i> <\u202f0.01) and perineal and rectal temperatures (<i>p</i> <\u202f0.0001). Bias was -0.2\u00b0C (ocular vs. rectal) and 2\u00b0C (perineal vs. rectal). Perineal temperature, despite numerical differences, correlated well with rectal temperature, allowing indirect estimation with a correction factor, and was unaffected by ambient temperature.

In 2023, the isolated and well-protected reefs around Little Cayman experienced a MHW of\u2009>\u200917 Degree Heating Weeks (DHW), far exceeding any DHW measure previously captured. During the peak of the heatwave,\u2009~\u200980% of all corals were either bleached or showing signs of mortality. On the final survey date ~54% of all corals surveyed were recorded as dead. However, we identified significant differences in bleaching susceptibility and mortality across taxonomic groups, related to different life history strategies. Notably, weedy coral taxa such as Agaricia spp., Porites astreoides, and Porites porites, experienced high bleaching and suffered extensive mortality. Meanwhile, stress-tolerant reef building taxa such as Orbicella spp., experienced bleaching, but suffered low mortality. Given Little Cayman reefs have not been exposed to previous thermal stress events, the highly sensitive weedy taxa disproportionately contributed to coral abundance. Thus, the occurrence of a high magnitude - long duration heatwave resulted in catastrophic mortality of corals in Little Cayman, despite ~57% of the coastal environment being classified as no-take Marine Protected Areas.

However, tibial fractures are more frequent in cementless OUKA than in cemented OUKA, especially in Asian countries. A hybrid option, with a cementless femur and cemented tibia, may, therefore, be a good compromise. This study compares the clinical results of hybrid OUKA with those of fully cemented OUKA. Materials and methods This retrospective study included 108 consecutive unicompartmental knee arthroplasties implanted between September 2016 and September 2018 in our hospital. Cases were divided into two groups: those using cemented fixation and those using hybrid fixation OUKAs. Pre- and postoperative knee range of motion (ROM), operation time, pre-and postoperative Oxford knee score (OKS), and complications were compared between the groups two years after OUKA was performed. Results There was no significant difference in pre- and postoperative ROM, operation time, and OKS performed unilateral OUKA, but mean OKS was higher in the hybrid group than in the cemented group performed bilateral OUKA (p<0.01). Both groups included one revision to total knee arthroplasty each. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of revision (p=0.723).

This study aims to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to identify hotspot areas and associated factors for stunting and wasting among children under five in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. <b>Methods:</b> A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted. Data were obtained from the 2019 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS). A total of 653 children under five years old were included in this study. The data were collected using a multistage sampling technique to select the study participants. ArcGis Version 10.7 was used for geospatial analysis. A Bayesian logistic regression model was used to determine the associated factors for undernutrition.

Ethoxyquin, commonly used to mitigate this risk, has been banned in some markets due to its genotoxicity, driving the search for alternative antioxidants. The traditional method to evaluate this risk, the SW-846 1050 test, is costly and time-consuming. We used the simpler and cheaper OXITEST method to assess the oxidative stability of FM by comparing oxygen consumption in FM with and without antioxidants. Fresh FM without antioxidants was used, which was stored at -30\u00b0C for 6\u2009months. FM contained 7.2% moisture, 18.8% ash, 64.3% protein, and 9.7% crude fat; of the lipids, 75% were neutral, and 25% were phospholipids. The fatty acid profile of the lipids revealed high levels of EPA and DHA, with a DHA/EPA ratio greater than 1, which makes the FM more prone to oxidation compared to anchovy oil. Initial results demonstrated oxygen consumption in FM samples, although the inflection point (IP) was not detected. In a second step, after optimizing the sample volume (50\u2009g), temperature (80\u00b0C), and time (4\u2009h), oxygen consumption was evaluated by OXITEST in FM samples with increasing concentrations of ethoxyquin, demonstrating an inverse correlation between concentrations of ethoxyquin and oxygen consumption (Pearson's linear). Finally, we evaluated FM samples with various commercial antioxidants and compared the area under the curve for oxygen pressure versus time using FM alone as a negative control and FM with 750\u2009ppm of ethoxyquin as the positive control. OXITEST measurements revealed differences in the rate of oxygen pressure loss among the studied agents, offering a comparative measure of antioxidant efficiency.

All populations had unique responses of critical thermal maximum, aerobic scope and exercise recovery to temperature. Despite populations from warm habitats exhibiting higher thermal tolerance than populations from cooler habitats, summer steelhead from warm habitats appear to be more vulnerable to the physiological consequences of warming based on the extreme temperatures they already experience during the summer.

The objective of this study is to analyze the impacts of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on the dynamics and functionality of the mitochondrial network within skeletal muscle. 20 young male participants were assigned to either HIIT or MICT group. Initial assessments of exercise-related indicators were conducted, followed by skeletal muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis before, 1 day after, and 6 weeks post-experiment. We utilized multi-dimensional myofiber imaging to analyze mitochondrial morphology and arrangement, and assessed citrate synthase activity, complex I activity, and dynamics-related mRNA. Both training modalities increased VO<sub>2max</sub>, W<sub>max</sub>, citrate synthase and complex I activities, mitochondrial content, and volume density, though the changes differed between the two groups. 6 weeks training induced remodeling of the mitochondrial network within skeletal muscle. Before training, the network appeared sparse and punctate. After MICT, it adopted a grid-like structure with partially robust longitudinal connections. In contrast, HIIT resulted in a less obvious grid structure but showed a stronger longitudinally oriented network. Training also increased mRNA expression of mitochondrial fusion proteins and decreased fission protein expression, with these effects being more pronounced in HIIT. Similarly, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1-alpha mRNA expression showed a comparable trend, though the changes differed between 1 day and 6 weeks of training. In conclusion, HIIT and MICT induce distinct mitochondrial adaptation in skeletal muscle, reflected in different network remodeling and molecular pathways. These findings may be due to HIIT's more pronounced effect on mitochondrial dynamics or respiratory function, but the study has only conducted preliminary observational experiments and further evidence is required for confirmation.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "17"}}, {"article_title": "Stigma experiences and adaptations in accessing healthcare services among hill tribes in Thailand: A qualitative study.", "article_abstract": "One of the significant barriers to accessing healthcare services is the stigma experienced from healthcare workers.

As a result, it is generally observed that minimum teaching takes place during these emergencies. This study aimed to formulate a simulation learning module centered on chosen obstetrical emergencies and evaluate its efficacy in measuring the competency of undergraduate midwifery students. Design and participants The study utilized a non-randomized time series interventional research design among 188 midwifery students (control group 90, intervention group 98). A hybrid simulation was administered to the intervention group. The research employed several tools:\u00a0a proforma for background variables, a structured questionnaire, and the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) of selected obstetrical emergencies. Results In the present study, 98% of participants in the control group demonstrated inadequate competency in the pretest, post-test I, and post-test II. In contrast, all participants (100%) in the intervention group had adequate\u00a0competency followed by moderately adequate competency in the post-test I and post-test II. The study reported that there was a significant difference between the assessments (pretest, post-test-I, post-test-II) in the knowledge and skills of the interventional group with the effect size (eta squared=0.70, 0.99), respectively. The results showed a statistically significant difference (P<0.001) in overall competency scores between the control and intervention groups at pretest, with a moderate effect size (Cohen's d=0.68). The intervention group demonstrated substantial improvements at post-test I (Cohen's d=23.61) and post-test II (Cohen's d=15.83). Conclusion Hybrid simulation is an appropriate method for equipping healthcare providers to gain and maintain competence in managing obstetric emergencies.

An 87-year-old female underwent right TKA followed by left TKA 5\u2009months later. Six weeks after left TKA, a painful subcutaneous induration appeared in the left medial thigh. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 30\u221750-mm multifocal mass. The cystic fluid was brown and cloudy, indicating an infected cyst. Oral antimicrobial therapy was initiated for 7\u2009days. Nine weeks after the left TKA, a left calcaneal fracture occurred. Subsequently, edema of the lower extremities and pain in the left knee gradually developed. Arthrocentesis was performed twice: joint fluid Gram staining and culture examination were negative. However, at 12.5\u2009weeks, an alpha-defensin test of the synovial fluid was positive. Therefore, PJI was diagnosed. DAIR was performed, followed by multiantibiotic therapy. The infection subsided gradually. Edema of the lower limbs was treated with oral diuretics, lymphatic massage, and compression stockings. Consequently, the lower limb edema also improved. In this case, infection of a latent subcutaneous cyst in the thigh occurred and spread around the prosthesis due to leg edema, which was associated with loss of lower limb motion due to a calcaneal fracture. The presence of a potential thigh subcutaneous cyst is a risk factor for PJI. Moreover, lower extremity edema occurs by decreasing lower extremity motion, such as after a calcaneal fracture, and it increases the risk of extending extra-articular infection to the PJI.

OLM is an angiotensin receptor blocker and is commonly used to treat hypertension. However, OLM has low water solubility and low bioavailability of 26%. It is understood that OLM is unstable in aqueous media; however, this hydrolysis has not been specifically studied in a way that has produced reliable, publishable data. Previously published analytical methods tend to focus mainly on quantitative measurement of OLM, but not quantitative measurement of OL. The objective of this study was to investigate the solubility and aqueous hydrolysis of OLM in different pH buffers by developing an analytical method for the simultaneous measurement of OLM and OL. A novel HPLC method was developed and validated to simultaneously quantify OLM and OL. The solubility of OLM was pH-dependent 37\u00b0C, which could lead to food effects and precipitation of OLM in the small intestine. The aqueous hydrolysis of OLM was rapid and significant and followed the zero-order kinetic model with different hydrolysis rates varying across different pH levels in the order: pH 1.2 < pH 3.5 < pH 4.6 \u2248 pH 6. These findings indicate that, in addition to low water solubility, aqueous hydrolysis in the gastrointestinal tract contributes to OLM's low bioavailability.

AtRGS1 possesses both a seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain connected to a cytoplasmic Regulator of G Protein Signaling domain (RGS box domain) by a flexible linker region. This study presents the novel function of a highly conserved, known phosphorylation site, Ser278, within this linker region utilizing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with <i>in vivo</i> experimental validation. We show that phosphorylation at Ser278 is crucial for establishing specific AtRGS1 interactions with AtGPA1, primarily by stabilizing the positioning and orientation of the RGS domain within the membrane. Phosphorylation at Ser278 enhances the formation of stable hydrogen bonds between phosphorylated Ser278 and conserved residues within the RGS box domain, influencing the flexibility of RGS domain mobility and thus modulating its interface to AtGPA1. Consistent with the MD simulations, <i>in vivo</i> assays demonstrated that this phosphorylation reduced the binding of AtRGS1 to AtGPA1 and conferred changes in physiology. Specifically, the non-phosphorylation mutation of Ser278 decreased both plant immune responses and AtRGS1 endocytosis evoked by the bacterial effector, flg22.

Urbanization and lifestyle changes are reportedly contributing to the increasing incidence of T2DM worldwide. The prevalence of T2DM is also increasing among women who wish to become pregnant, owing to the growing overall proportion of women with T2DM, the increasing prevalence of obesity, and the rising average age of childbirth. Preconception care is warranted in this demographic\u00a0to optimize glycemic control, improve pregnancy outcomes, and reduce the risk of congenital anomalies and perinatal complications.\u00a0Educational support that includes not only glycemic control but also increased physical activity (PA) and lifestyle modifications is important to delivering effective preconception care. Herein, we report the case of a woman in her 30s with T2DM, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Her early glycemic control was suboptimal (glycated hemoglobin: 8.9%, time in range (TIR): 36.6%), her pregnancy preparation was delayed, and a personalized PA program was eventually introduced that included continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) reviewed by a physical therapist.\u00a0The intervention lasted four months and included continuous feedback and adjustments to the timing, intensity, and activity goals of the patient's exercise regimen\u00a0based on her CGM trends.

Yet, low engagement and uptake have challenged DHIs' potency. Human-centered design (HCD) integrates end-users (i.e., future users of the DHI) into iterative design processes, thereby prioritizing their needs and preferences. Clinical scientists are increasingly embracing HCD, but often lack expertise in how to apply these methods in practice. We provide a template for creating a design session interview guide in a needs assessment, which is the first phase in our HCD process to design a DHI for dysregulated eating in adolescents. To create the guide, we first conducted a \"needs assessment\" within our team to identify important topic areas that required feedback from adolescents (\"investigate\"). We then consolidated these ideas into structured domains through a brainstorming process (\"ideate\"), which resulted in an initial draft of a design session guide (\"prototype\"). Next, we piloted the prototype with members of our team and a technology-savvy adolescent (\"evaluate\") to refine it prior to administration with the target audience (\"refine and develop\"). Our internal needs assessment identified that we needed to learn adolescents' preferences for technology (e.g., desired features), clinical content (e.g., areas for specialized support), delivery (e.g., coaching), and developmental relevance (e.g., focus on self-regulation). We organized these topics into six domains: dysregulated eating experiences and current help-seeking behaviors, major challenges that impact dysregulated eating, preferred intervention features and skills, preferences for coaching support, the potential role of sensors to assess activity behaviors, and preferred aesthetics and brand. We created relevant prompts within each domain, revised, and reordered them to elicit more comprehensive responses during administration. Next, we practiced administering the guide internally amongst our team, then with a non-participant adolescent volunteer. Using HCD, we created a semi-structured design session interview guide that will be administered in an upcoming needs assessment with adolescents and will continue to evolve as we learn from adolescents.

This study investigated the pearl millet's morphological, physiological, and molecular responses subjected to individual and combined drought and salt stresses for 25 days. Significant reductions in morphological traits, such as plant height, shoot and root fresh weights and lengths, and leaf numbers were observed. Furthermore, key physiological parameters, including chlorophyll content, stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, and transpiration rates notably declined, indicating a complex interaction between stress factors and water regulation mechanisms. Protein expression analysis showed differential upregulation and downregulation patterns between the control and stressed pearl millet plants. Gene ontology mapping identified key biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components of differentially expressed proteins associated with individual and combined stresses. Notably, a high number of unclassified proteins were identified, indicating the presence of potentially novel proteins involved in stress adaptation. Catalytic and binding activities were the predominant molecular functions detected across treatments suggesting their central role in stress response.

Methods We studied 299 manufacturing company employees who attended a 60-to-90-minute BLS course. Participants were divided into three groups based on the number of previous attendance sessions: none, one or two, and three or more. A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess their levels of confidence in checking responses, chest compressions, and the use of an automated external defibrillator (score range: 0-5) and knowledge (0-7) before and after the BLS course. We examined the change in scores using a two-way repeated analysis of variance. Results Confidence and knowledge scores increased for all participants after the BLS course (p < 0.001). Time-by-group\u00a0interactions among the three groups for confidence and knowledge scores were all\u00a0significant. The lower the number of previous courses attended, the greater the increase in scores.

This paper examines qualitative data from an evaluation of the Learning Initiative on Norms, Exploitation and Abuse radio drama intervention aimed at preventing age-disparate transactional sex in Tanzania's Shinyanga region. We delivered the drama to households on flash drives and led structured household discussion sessions. We conducted in-depth interviews with 18 adult men caregivers before (September 2021) and after the intervention (December 2021) and used thematic analysis and the framework method to examine indications of change in attitudes, beliefs, norms and behaviours. Findings provided practical lessons for future interventions aiming to engage men, specifically as caregivers, and demonstrated promising indications of change. We found that the home-based delivery of the intervention coupled with household discussions led to high engagement from men. This engagement fostered expansion of participant's conceptualisation of fatherhood to include discussing (age-disparate transactional) sex with adolescent girls, as well as with other men in the community, with the goal of protecting girls. We also found that the drama led to an expansion of the existing norm that it is everyone's responsibility within a community to protect girls, to include protecting girls from age-disparate transactional sex; highlighting the success of norms programming that reinforces existing positive norms rather than introducing new norms. This study highlights the potential for edutainment using a variety of acceptable and relatable characters and storylines to model positive behaviours performed by men, and home-based, discussion-oriented approaches to foster meaningful change.

The association between patient-perceived extensive collaboration across clinics (exposure) and patient health literacy (outcome) was assessed using four selected scales and regression models. Results were presented as both unadjusted and adjusted, accounting for potential confounders. <b>Results:</b> A total of 3,435 outpatients received a survey, with 1,655 responses.

A qRT-PCR expression analysis of the 10 PvSRS in root/nodule of inoculated plants, revealed that all the PvSRS genes are expressed at different stages of the symbiosis, albeit at different levels. Based on what is known for L. japonicus, we demonstrated that the PvSRS10 gene -with highest expression during symbiosis- is transcriptionally activated by NF-Y transcription factor, thus indicating its participation in the NIN-NF-Y regulatory cascade. Based on our previous work about the relevant role of members from the MADS-domain/AGL transcription factors as regulators of the N-fixing symbiosis, in this work we demonstrated the transcriptional regulation of PvSRS10 by the MADS-TF PvFUL-like. Analysis of protein-protein interaction networks predicted thatPvSRS5 and PvSRS6 interact with proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and the auxin-activated signaling pathway. The regulatory mechanisms of PvSRS TF in common bean symbiosis may be related to auxin biosynthesis regulation, that is essential for determinate nodules development. Our study highlights the role of PvSRS TF in the N-/fixing symbiosis, a relevant process for sustainable agriculture.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "05", "day": "02"}}, {"article_title": "Illicit Substance Use and Harm in Young Adulthood: the Role of Substance Use in Close Relationships and Individual Social Skills.", "article_abstract": "To examine illicit substance use across young adulthood and explore the extent to which social skills moderate the relationship between use and harm. 1,404 (761 women) from the Australian Temperament Project (est. 1983) participated across young adulthood (age 19-20, 23-24, and 27-28\u00a0years).

Although current biochemical assays and immunofluorescence microscopy can reveal how mitochondrial function influences cellular metabolism, they cannot achieve live observation and tracking changes in mitochondrial networks through fusion and fission events. Holotomographic microscopy (HTM) has emerged as a promising technique for real-time, label-free visualization of ECs and their organelles, such as mitochondria. This nondestructive, noninterfering live cell imaging method offers unprecedented opportunities to observe mitochondrial network dynamics. However, because existing image processing tools based on immunofluorescence microscopy techniques are incompatible with HTM images, a machine-learning model is required. Here, we developed a model using a U-net learner with a Resnet18 encoder to identify four classes within HTM images: mitochondrial networks, cell borders, ECs, and background. This method accurately identifies mitochondrial structures and positions. With high accuracy and similarity metrics, the output image successfully provides visualization of mitochondrial networks within HTM images of ECs.

Here, we explain this feature by examining how configurations or locations are identified across different branches in superposition. We show that, in the presence of symmetries, whether a system is in \"the same\" or \"different\" configurations across the branches depends on the choice of QRF. Hence, sameness and difference - and thus superposition and entanglement - lose their absolute meaning. We apply these ideas to the context of semi-classical spacetimes in superposition and use coincidences of four scalar fields to construct a comparison map between spacetime points in the different branches.

In the central nervous system, SUR1 is weakly expressed in some brain regions but is induced by pathological conditions in the different cell types of the neurovascular unit. Therefore, we first analyzed the expression of SUR1 in various rat tissues and brain regions to identify SUR1 isoforms and their mRNA exon composition under physiological conditions. Later, we focused on the SUR1 expression in the brain and heart after ischemia/reperfusion. We observed two SUR1 isoforms (170 and 60-75\u202fkDa) abundantly expressed in most rat tissues, except for the testis and brain, where basal expression of these isoforms was relatively low and exhibit a band of 100\u202fkDa.

Results from <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments indicated that SUR1 isoforms previously identified (170 and 60-75\u202fkDa) were dramatically overexpressed in the brain after middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion.

Summary RR from 51 studies with 62,602 BC cases showed that overall dairy consumption is inversely associated with BC risk (RR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.84-0.98, I<sup>2</sup> = 75%), particularly among individuals aged over 45 (RR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.68-0.98, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). Notably, higher intake of low-fat dairy products showed potential protective effects (RR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.84-0.98, I<sup>2</sup> = 56%), especially in premenopausal women (skimmed milk, RR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76-0.97, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). Fermented dairy products, including yogurt, exhibited a decreased BC risk, particularly in postmenopausal women (RR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.87-0.96, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). However, a positive association was observed between total milk intake and the risk of estrogen receptor-negative BC (RR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.08-1.59, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). This meta-analysis provides comprehensive insights into the association between specific dairy product consumption and BC risk. The findings highlight the protective impact of specific dairy products on different subtypes, offering valuable insights for BC prevention.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "02", "day": "27"}}, {"article_title": "Identification and validation of differentially expressed genes in allergic asthma pathogenesis using whole-transcriptome sequencing.", "article_abstract": "This study aims to systematically identify differential gene expression profiles in patients with allergic asthma through whole-transcriptome sequencing and validate the role of these genes in asthma pathogenesis, thereby uncovering potential molecular mechanisms.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "16"}}, {"article_title": "Hydrotherapy and acupressure in restless legs syndrome: results of a randomized, controlled, three-armed, pilot study (HYDRAC-study).", "article_abstract": "Non-pharmacological interventions for restless legs syndrome (RLS) are frequently used, although scientific evidence remains limited.

This qualitative analysis sought to address this gap and learn more about how adolescent and young adult TNY and their siblings experienced and managed anti-trans stigma across different settings and over time. Using a reflexive thematic analysis and template organizing approach, we analyzed one-on-one, semi-structured, separate interviews (N=88) with 10 TNY and their 10 siblings (N=20) who completed at least four of five waves of the Trans Teen and Family Narratives Project, a mixed-methods, longitudinal study of TNY and their families in the New England region of the US, conducted from 2016-2019. TNY and their siblings engaged in meaning making about the TNY's (and for some siblings, their own) susceptibility to anti-trans stigma within their families, communities, and nation and with respect to a shifting sociopolitical climate and the TNY's gender affirmation trajectory. Four themes were generated: exercising agency, schemas for understanding stigma, \"passing,\" and awareness of their spatio-temporal and relational positionality.

CVM composition varies significantly between individuals and is shaped by factors including diet, age, environmental exposures, and lifestyle. Understanding these influences may shed light on how microbial imbalances contribute to infection susceptibility and the development of reproductive health disorders. Five distinct community state types (CSTs) classify common CVM compositions. Most CSTs (I, II, III, V) are characterized by a dominant <i>Lactobacillus</i> species and are associated with better or neutral reproductive health, including reduced coincident detection of STIs such as <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i>. In contrast, CST IV is composed of diverse, predominantly anaerobic, microbial species and is associated with CVM dysbiosis, bacterial vaginosis, and a heightened risk of STI acquisition. This review examines the complex interplay between the CVM, <i>C. trachomatis</i> infection, and host immune responses, highlighting the role of metabolites such as short-chain and long-chain fatty acids, indole, and iron in modulating pathogen survival and host defenses.

The main cause for this is their high thermal conductivity as they are made out of metal. The use of glass support pillars would improve the Ug-value by 10-20% depending on the pillar size and pillar separation. Additionally, a directly bonded glass pillar, made from the same material as the glass panes, without the need for any adhesives, would improve recycling and visual appearance. We demonstrate a new technique for manufacturing glass support pillars using laser welding to bond, and laser cutting to shape the pillar to the substrate glass. We show that these pillars are able to withstand the expected atmospheric compressive force related to a pillar separation of 20\u00a0mm with promise for future research.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "28"}}, {"article_title": "Biomaterials-based approaches to mandibular tissue engineering: where we were, where we are, where we are going.", "article_abstract": "The mandible is the largest craniofacial bone and plays a crucial role in speech, mastication, swallowing, and facial aesthetics. The form or function of the mandible can be altered by defects as a result of tumors, trauma, infection, and congenital conditions. This paper covers the evolution of biomaterials-based approaches to the reconstruction of critical size mandibular defects. Historically the gold standard for critical size mandibular defect repair has been autologous fibula grafts. The emergence of the field of tissue engineering has led to the current research on biomaterial scaffolds, cells, and biological factors to design highly tunable, bio-inspired, tissue regenerative implants. Scaffold materials can be synthetic or natural and can be fabricated using a variety of additive manufacturing techniques. Mesenchymal stem cells, bone morphogenetic proteins, and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 are frequently added to scaffolds. While great progress has been made, there are still barriers to translating this research to patients, ranging from insufficient bone regeneration in animal studies to the feasibility of establishing a good manufacturing practice.

Utilizing density functional theory calculations, we explore the adsorption and diffusion of selenium at a low-coverage regime of 0.25 ML on a broader range of metal surfaces, including Ni, Cu, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, and Au. Our results reveal that selenium exhibits a distinct preference for three-fold or four-fold high-coordination sites on most studied surfaces. We further analyze the minimum energy diffusion pathways, demonstrating that the energy barrier for selenium's surface diffusion varies significantly based on the orientation and nature of the metal surfaces. Specifically, on (100) surfaces, selenium exhibits the highest diffusion energy, ranging from 0.60 eV in Au(100) to 1.12 eV in Pd(100). The diffusion behavior on (110) and (211) surfaces is also elaborated, emphasizing the unique trends observed compared to previously studied elements like sulfur.

To investigate how temperature is biologically maintained and regulated and its biological impact on organisms, it is essential to measure the spatial distribution and/or temporal changes of temperature across different biological scales, from whole organism to subcellular structures. Fluorescent nanothermometers have been developed as probes for temperature measurement by fluorescence microscopy for applications in microscopic scales where macroscopic temperature sensors are inaccessible, such as embryos, tissues, cells, and organelles. Although fluorescent nanothermometers have been developed from various materials, fluorescent protein-based ones are especially of interest because they can be introduced into cells as the transgenes for expression with or without specific localization, making them suitable for less-invasive temperature observation in living biological samples. In this article, we review protein-based fluorescent nanothermometers also known as genetically-encoded temperature indicators (GETIs), covering most published GETIs, for developers, users, and researchers in thermal biology as well as interested readers. We provide overviews of the temperature sensing mechanisms and measurement methods of these protein-based fluorescent nanothermometers.

And yet, as individuals who prefer blue eyes are more inclined to mate with blue-eyed partners and invest in blue-eyed offspring, any blue-eye preference (whether random or arising from the bias for colorful stimuli shared by all recognition systems) becomes rapidly linked to the blue-eye trait. Thus, blue eyes gain an edge by working like a peacock's colorful tail <i>and</i> a nestling's colorful mouth: twice self-reinforcing, \"double runaway\" evolution via sexual and parental selection.

Previous ancient DNA studies on Longshan culture populations have focused on individuals from inland Shandong, with no ancient DNA data available from island populations. In this study, we present the first ancient DNA analysis from individuals associated with the Longshan and subsequent Yueshi cultures on the Tuoji Island. Our findings indicate that, despite the widespread cultural influence of the inland Longshan culture in Shandong, the genetic ancestry of the Tuoji Island individuals primarily reflects connections to the preceding Dawenkou culture, with additional ancestry linked to the coastal regions of southern China.

Erastin treatment markedly reduced cell viability and increased iron content, elevating ferroptosis marker genes (<i>COX2, ACSL4, PTGS2, NOX1</i>) while reducing <i>GPX4</i> and <i>FTH1</i> levels. The overexpression of GPRC5D-AS1 reversed these changes, enhancing antioxidant capacity and cell survival. Conversely, silencing <i>SLC7A11</i> diminished the protective effects of GPRC5D-AS1 on cell proliferation and ferroptosis. These findings suggest that GPRC5D-AS1 overexpression increases <i>SLC7A11</i> expression and reduces ferroptosis incidence in HSKM.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "16"}}, {"article_title": "Growth of rehabilitation students in first and second years: A text mining approach.", "article_abstract": "This research used text mining to determine the impact of curricular experiences in each year of study on the formation of professional identity among students aspiring to become physical therapists (PTs) and occupational therapists (OTs).", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "12", "day": "27"}}, {"article_title": "Effect of docetaxel administration on fluid dynamics in mice.", "article_abstract": "The taxane chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel has been used as a therapy for various cancers.

Recent studies suggest that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in cancer progression and immune modulation, emerging as potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we investigated the expression and functional role of LINC00892 in LUAD using RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and functional assays in vitro and in vivo. We found that LINC00892 is significantly downregulated in LUAD tissues compared to normal tissues, and lower LINC00892 expression correlates with poorer overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free interval (PFI), particularly in younger patients and those with early-stage disease. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that LINC00892 expression is positively correlated with immune cell infiltration, including CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and negatively correlated with tumor-promoting Th2 cells, suggesting its role in shaping the tumor immune microenvironment. In vitro functional assays showed that LINC00892 overexpression inhibits LUAD cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while promoting apoptosis. Mechanistically, LINC00892 upregulation was found to suppress epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by increasing E-cadherin expression and decreasing levels of N-cadherin, vimentin, and slug. Additionally, in an in vivo mouse xenograft model, LINC00892 overexpression suppressed tumor growth and metastasis, accompanied by enhanced immune cell infiltration such as CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.

These disturbances contribute to extensive damage across various tissues and organs, giving rise to severe complications such as vision loss, kidney failure, amputations, and higher morbidity and mortality rates. Furthermore, DM imposes a substantial economic and emotional burden on patients, families, and healthcare systems. Mitophagy, a selective process that targets the clearance of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria, is pivotal for sustaining cellular homeostasis through mitochondrial turnover and recycling. Emerging evidence indicates that dysfunctional mitophagy acts as a key pathogenic driver in the pathogenesis of DM and its associated complications. Natural small molecules are particularly attractive in this regard, offering advantages such as low toxicity, favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, excellent biocompatibility, and a broad range of biochemical activities. This review systematically evaluates the mechanistic roles of natural small molecules-including ginsenosides, resveratrol, and berberine-in enhancing mitophagy and restoring mitochondrial homeostasis via activation of core signaling pathways (e.g., PINK1/Parkin, BNIP3/NIX, and FUNDC1). These pathways collectively ameliorate pathological hallmarks of DM, such as oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the integration of nanotechnology with these compounds optimizes their bioavailability and tissue-specific targeting, thereby establishing a transformative therapeutic platform for DM management. Current evidence demonstrates that mitophagy modulation by natural small molecules not only offers novel therapeutic strategies for DM and its chronic complications but also advances the mechanistic foundation for future drug development targeting metabolic disorders.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "16"}}, {"article_title": "The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in colorectal cancer: mechanism and intervention of traditional Chinese medicine and chemical compound.", "article_abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is globally recognized as the third most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The etiology of CRC is multifactorial, arising from a complex interplay of genetic alterations, environmental exposures, and age-related physiological changes. Among the numerous signaling pathways that regulate cellular homeostasis, the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway not only plays a critical role in embryonic development and cell proliferation but also contributes to the initiation and progression of various malignancies, including CRC. Dysregulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is a hallmark of CRC, playing a pivotal role in regulating chemoresistance and driving invasive and metastatic behaviors. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is characterized by its multi-target and multi-pathway mechanisms. Extensive studies have demonstrated that TCM can inhibit the activity of CRC cells by targeting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway and significantly alleviate symptoms in CRC animal models, demonstrating its potential therapeutic value for the treatment of CRC. This review primarily focuses on the literature published in the past 5\u00a0years, retrieved from databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE, and Springer, concerning the targeting of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway for the treatment of CRC.

Furthermore, the experimental results and conclusions from these studies are thoroughly analyzed and discussed. Through a comprehensive review of the literature, we conclude that TCM exhibits multi-level, multi-target, and multi-faceted effects in the prevention and treatment of CRC.

Previous studies have attempted to reduce radiation exposure by equally lowering the temporal sampling rate; however, it may miss the peak of arterial enhancement, leading to underestimation of blood flow parameter. Here, we investigate the feasibility of using a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate perfusion maps from 3 phases of CTP (mCTP). The three phases were chosen based on the multiphase computed tomography angiography scanning protocol: the peak arterial input function phase, the peak venous output function phase, and the delayed venous output function phase. The findings demonstrate that the GAN model achieved high visual overlap and performance for cerebral blood flow and time-to-maximum maps, with a mean structural similarity index measure of 0.921 to 0.971 and 0.817 to 0.883, a mean normalized root mean squared error of 0.019 to 0.108 and 0.058 to 0.064, and a mean learned perceptual image patch similarity of 0.039 to 0.088 and 0.141 to 0.146, respectively.

In the context of neurological diseases, transplantation of NSCs has been shown to facilitate neurological repair through paracrine mechanisms. NSC-derived small extracellular vesicles (NSC-sEVs), a prominent component of the NSC secretome, play a crucial role in modulating various physiological and pathological processes, such as regulating the NSC microenvironment, promoting endogenous NSC differentiation, and facilitating the maturation of neurons and glial cells. Moreover, NSC-sEVs exhibit reduced immunogenicity, decreased tumorigenic potential, and enhanced ability to traverse the blood-brain barrier. Consequently, NSC-sEVs present novel therapeutic approaches as non-cellular treatments for neurological disorders and are poised to serve as a viable alternative to stem cell therapies. Furthermore, NSC-sEVs can be manipulated to enhance production efficiency, improve biological activity, and optimize targeting specificity, thereby significantly advancing the utilization of NSC-sEVs in clinical settings for neurological conditions. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the biological functions of NSC-sEVs, their therapeutic implications and underlying molecular mechanisms in diverse neurological disorders, as well as the potential for engineering NSC-sEVs as drug delivery platforms.

Persistent activation of NF-\u03baB has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases and cancer. A critical mechanism to prevent excessive inflammation and its harmful effects is the timely termination of NF-\u03baB's transcriptional activity on target genes. This termination can be facilitated through the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of chromatin-bound RelA, the most active subunit of NF-\u03baB. Several multi-subunit cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases, composed of elongin B/C, cullin2/5, and SOCS-box proteins, have been identified to target RelA for degradation. These E3s, known as ECS complexes, use SOCS-box proteins as substrate-recognizing subunits to engage RelA. SOCS1 is the first identified SOCS-box member that functions in ECS<sup>SOCS1</sup> to target chromatin-bound RelA for ubiquitination. Specifically, SOCS1 collaborates with accessory proteins COMMD1 and GCN5 to preferentially recognize Ser468-phosphorylated RelA. Our recent work demonstrates that WSB1 and WSB2 (WSB1/2), two additional SOCS-box proteins with structurally similar WD40 repeat domains, function as substrate-recognizing subunits of ECS<sup>WSB1/2</sup> to specifically mediate the ubiquitination and degradation of chromatin-associated RelA methylated at Lys314/315.

While percutaneous transluminal angioplasty remains the primary intervention, covered stents (CSs) have emerged as a valuable adjunct. This study evaluates the efficacy of CS\u00a0in reducing reinterventions and delaying subsequent procedures. Methods This retrospective study included patients who underwent their first CS placement at the SANFIL Vascular Access Centre between 2017 and 2022, involving arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and arteriovenous grafts (AVGs). The primary outcome was a comparison of the number of procedures 12 months before and after CS placement.

Results Eleven patients were included, 72.7% male, with a mean age of 74.6 \u00b1 8.8 years. Seven (63.6%) patients had an AVF. In the 12 months after CS placement, only two VAs did not require reintervention, while the remaining nine exhibited CS-related dysfunctions. The mean number of interventions in the 12 months before and after CS placement was similar (1.73 \u00b1 1.01 and 1.64 \u00b1 1.63, respectively; p = 0.85).

PP was significantly higher in AVFs than in AVGs. Conclusions CS placement may delay the need for subsequent interventions, but it does not significantly reduce the frequency of procedures or improve overall VA survival.

A common complication following HZ is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a severe and often chronic neuropathic pain within the site of the initial HZ outbreak. The recombinant Shingrix and live attenuated Zostavax vaccines were created to provide immunity against viral reactivation. The objective of this scoping review is to evaluate the literature to understand the additional factors that contribute to VZV reactivation and can result in HZ and PHN.\u00a0This review also aims to understand the vaccine efficacy (VE) of Shingrix and Zostavax in reducing VZV reactivation and PHN compared to non-vaccinated individuals. This study used the PubMed database to identify studies. Search terms included\u00a0chickenpox, postherpetic neuralgia, reactivation stimuli, Shingrix, shingles, varicella zoster, \"varicella zoster viral reactivation\", and Zostavax. The exclusion criteria were literature reviews, meta-analyses, case reports, and gray literature. Only studies published in English between January 1, 2018, and April 1, 2023, were included. There were 17 studies extracted that focused on VZV reactivation stimuli, which indicated that comorbidities/disease stress, unrelated medical interventions, lifestyle/environmental assault, and depression were potential inciting factors of viral reactivation. There were two studies regarding the effect of body mass index (BMI) on HZ risk with conflicting results; one found a higher correlation of HZ with an overweight BMI, while the other found no correlation with a higher BMI and instead reported a higher HZ incidence in those with a normal BMI. There were 15 studies covering VE for HZ prevention and seven studies for VE against PHN, with some overlapping studies measuring both data values. Overall, the findings revealed that vaccinated individuals had consistently lower incidence rates of HZ and PHN compared to their non-vaccinated counterparts, as well as a consistently superior VE in Shingrix and a notable decline in VE with age. Three articles with data regarding PHN pathophysiology suggested that it is more likely caused by neurological damage with some genetic influence rather than further viral reactivation. While further investigation into the relationship between viral reactivation and risk factors is warranted based on this analysis, the results suggest that immunosuppression that has been previously linked to or correlated with these variables likely also contributes to VZV reactivation and PHN.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "03", "day": "31"}}, {"article_title": "Exploring the Impact of Workplace Satisfaction, Leadership, and Career Development on Employee Retention in Hospitals.", "article_abstract": "Background and objectives This study examines hospital employees' perceptions of workplace satisfaction, communication, and professional development, providing insights into key factors affecting job satisfaction, retention, and the overall work environment.

The EVendo score showed the highest AUROC of 0.92 (p \u2264 0.001) with a diagnostic accuracy of 86.56%, followed by the P<sup>2</sup>MS index, which had an AUROC of 0.859 and diagnostic accuracy of 81.71%, splenic stiffness with an AUROC of 0.838 and diagnostic accuracy of 66.47%, and INPR with an AUROC of 0.90 and diagnostic accuracy of 58.24%. EVendo score was associated with higher sensitivity, 92.94%, and specificity, 71.88%, for predicting HRV. Conclusion Non-invasive indices, mainly the EVendo score, showed a very good diagnostic performance for predicting HRV in resource-limited settings like Pakistan. These tools might have the potential to restrict indications for routine endoscopy, thus improving patient management and reducing the cost and economic burden.

In Portugal, one of the European leaders in the incidence of renal function replacement therapy, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis continue to be the focus of treatment, even in patients with multiple comorbidities, low functional reserve, and care dependency. However, several studies have revealed that these therapies in fragile patients do not provide quality of life or a greater survival rate but are associated with increased suffering due to the loss of functional capacity, with a subsequent need to abandon dialysis. Nephrology nursing in Portugal has always followed this more technical aspect necessary for dialysis. However, it has not dedicated itself to conservative treatment or other nephrology areas requiring differentiated palliative care, such as cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). Conservative treatment is a valid alternative that corresponds to the continuation of comprehensive therapy for patients with CKD without resorting to dialysis techniques. It seeks to prevent the deterioration of residual renal function while alleviating symptoms and complications resulting from disease progression, with personalized palliative care support aimed at optimizing the physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being of the patient and their family. On the other hand, despite being palliative, patients with CRS can benefit from more invasive techniques such as assisted peritoneal ultrafiltration to control symptoms, along with an educational approach that promotes their empowerment. This need for a paradigm shift led us to implement a specific nursing consultation for conservative treatment and CRS, ensuring personalized monitoring of these illnesses.

Traditional surgical techniques, such as exostectomy and tendo-Achilles lengthening (TAL), effectively redistribute plantar pressure but often fail to provide durable soft tissue coverage. This study describes the first documented use of a Dufourmentel rhomboid flap for reconstructing a chronic plantar midfoot ulcer in a 59-year-old female with CNO and poorly controlled diabetes. The patient presented with a non-healing ulcer over a prominent osseous deformity, complicated by advanced neuropathy and a rocker-bottom foot. Surgical intervention included TAL, exostectomy, and meticulous wound debridement, followed by primary closure using a Dufourmentel flap to achieve tension-free, durable coverage. Postoperatively, the patient was managed with strict immobilization using a total contact cast and transitioned to a Charcot Restraint Orthotic Walker (CROW) boot. Despite partial non-compliance with weight-bearing restrictions, the wound healed completely by six months, with no recurrence. This case highlights the Dufourmentel flap as an innovative and effective reconstructive option for complex plantar ulcers in CNO, offering enhanced soft tissue resilience and long-term stability.

Temperament traits, enduring psychological characteristics, may significantly influence the clinical manifestation of depression and anxiety in hyperthyroid patients, yet they remain understudied. This study aimed to determine whether specific temperament traits in hyperthyroid individuals correlate with anxiety and depressive symptoms and explore their implications for personalized clinical management. Methods A total of 59\u00a0patients diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and 40 healthy controls participated in this study. All participants underwent clinical assessment, thyroid function testing (thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), T3, T4), and completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A). Demographic and clinical parameters, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, smoking status, and family history, were also documented. Statistical analyses included Mann-Whitney U tests for group comparisons, Spearman's correlation analysis for relationships between temperament traits and psychiatric symptoms, and generalized linear models (GLM) to identify predictors of depressive symptoms. Results Hyperthyroid patients exhibited significantly higher anxiety scores compared to controls (p<0.001), whereas depressive symptoms, although elevated, did not reach statistical significance (p>0.05). Temperament assessment revealed significantly increased depressive, cyclothymic, irritable, and anxious traits in patients compared to controls (p<0.001). Hyperthymic temperament showed no significant difference between groups. A notable positive correlation emerged between irritable temperament and increased depressive symptoms (r=0.635, p<0.001). Depressive temperament significantly predicted higher depression scores, while hyperthymic temperament appeared protective, associated with reduced depressive symptoms (p<0.05). Conclusions These findings highlight the importance of temperament traits as critical modulators of psychiatric outcomes in hyperthyroidism. Irritable and depressive temperaments may increase vulnerability to depressive disorders, whereas hyperthymic temperament could offer resilience.

This review synthesizes current research on ferroptosis mechanisms in CHD and emerging clinical intervention strategies. Ferroptosis is characterized by dysregulated iron metabolism, lipid peroxidation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, processes intimately linked to CHD pathophysiology. Under ischemic and hypoxic conditions commonly seen in coronary artery disease (CAD), cardiomyocytes become particularly susceptible to ferroptosis, resulting in cellular dysfunction and diminished cardiac performance. Mechanistic studies have revealed that altered expression of iron metabolism-related proteins (including GPX4, FTH1, TfR1, and HO-1), accumulation of lipid peroxidation products, and disruption of antioxidant defense systems (particularly the Nrf2/GPX4 pathway) are central to ferroptosis progression in cardiac tissue. Clinically, both specific ferroptosis inhibitors (such as Ferrostatin-1) and traditional medicine components (such as Puerarin) have emerged as promising therapeutic candidates, showing cardioprotective effects in experimental models.

Drone technology has emerged as an innovative tool for dengue management, offering capabilities such as aerial surveillance and targeted interventions. However, its adoption in rural communities is hindered by barriers related to community engagement and acceptance. This study aims to evaluate the barriers and opportunities for community engagement in drone-based dengue management within rural Malaysian settings. A cross-sectional study was conducted across six states representing rural Malaysia: Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, Johor, Kedah, and Perlis. A total of 190 participants were recruited using a stratified purposive sampling method. Data were collected via structured questionnaires assessing sociodemographic characteristics, perceptions of drone technology, and willingness to engage in dengue prevention activities, such as downloading a dengue-related application or participating in mosquito control training programs. Descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression were used to analyze factors influencing community engagement. Participants were predominantly female (67.4%) and of Malay ethnicity (>90%). Younger participants (<40 years) showed significantly lower willingness to participate in training programs (\"Maybe\" vs. \"No\": OR = 0.255, 95% CI: 0.067-0.968, p = 0.045), while age was not a significant predictor for app adoption. Negative perceptions of drone use and sociodemographic factors, such as housing type and residency duration, did not significantly influence willingness to engage. Despite these findings, qualitative responses highlighted concerns related to privacy, trust, and technological accessibility in rural areas. Drone-based dengue management in rural Malaysia faces challenges in community engagement, particularly among younger demographics. Tailored strategies, such as gamified training programs and targeted awareness campaigns, are necessary to address barriers and foster acceptance.

We evaluated 530 wheat core collections over five years, focusing on known heading date genes VRN-1 and PPD-1, and conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify new genetic loci related to DTH. The results revealed that Korean accessions exhibited the earliest DTH, with modern Korean varieties heading even earlier, reflecting a strong breeding focus on early heading. Among the existing heading date genes, VRN-1 and PPD-D1 were significantly associated with DTH in the wheat core collection. However, all Korean varieties carried the same alleles for each of VRN-A1, PPD-A1, and PPD-D1, resulting in low genetic diversity, which rendered the existing heading date genes insufficient to fully account for the variation in DTH within the Korean varieties. GWAS identified nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with DTH in Group A (entire collection filtered, n=518) and six in Group B (accessions with genotypes identical to Korean varieties filtered, n=231). Four key SNPs (AX-95222044 and AX-94685526 in Group A, and AX-94550996 and AX-94970315 in Group B) were selected based on their effect sizes on DTH. In both groups, accessions with alleles for early heading at both of the selected SNPs exhibited the earliest DTH, advancing by 7.7 to 8.9 days. These findings suggest that the selected SNPs, particularly those reflecting the genotypes of Korean varieties, effectively explain the variations in DTH among Korean varieties and could enhance wheat breeding efficiency in Korea. Further research is needed to validate the four selected SNPs and identify the underlying genes, which could serve as valuable markers for developing early-heading wheat varieties suited to Korean autumn-sowing conditions.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "30"}}, {"article_title": "Economic evaluation of Wolbachia deployment in Colombia: A modeling study.", "article_abstract": "Wolbachia are bacteria that inhibit dengue virus replication within the mosquito.

This longitudinal follow-up study of children whose mothers were enrolled in the Tanzania Mining and Health Cohort in Geita District in 2015 were assessed at 3-4 years of age for the current study between June 2019 - June 2020. Developmental outcomes (cognitive, social, motor, and language skills) were assessed using the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT). A quantile g-computation model evaluated the linkage between multi-chemical exposures and developmental milestones.

Postural control demands were varied by manipulating proprioceptive reliability (stable stance or sway-referencing). Young adults' listening and postural control remained unaffected by concurrent performances. During multitasking middle-aged and older adults maintained single-task levels in listening, however, their postural stability declined significantly. Stabilogram diffusion analysis identified efficiency and timing of long-term corrective mechanisms as the key processes affected by multitasking. We argue that middle-aged adults can maintain young-adult levels of postural stability under ideal conditions by cognitive compensation for sensorimotor decline, a process breaking down during multitasking.

In Ghana, although cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women, there is no national-level cervical cancer screening program, and only 2-4% of eligible Ghanaian women have ever been screened for cervical cancer. This study used an exploratory, sequential mixed-methods approach to examine barriers and facilitators to cervical cancer screening from women's and healthcare workers' perspectives. These were further informed by the Dynamic Sustainability Framework (DSF), in particular, two domains, namely the practice setting and ecological system. Two convenience samples of 215 women and 17 healthcare personnel were recruited for this study. All participants were from one of three selected clinics (Ejisu Government Hospital, Kumasi South Hospital, and the Suntreso Government Hospital) in the Ashanti region of Ghana. Descriptive analyses were used to group the data by practice setting. Statistical differences in means and proportions were used to evaluate women's barriers to cervical cancer screening. Quantitative findings from the women's survey informed qualitative, in-depth interviews with the healthcare workers and were analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis.

Answering this question is challenged by variation in data availability and quality as well as disruptive events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate the association between level of national action and temporal trends in multiple indicators related to health system capacity, antibiotic use (ABU), absolute rates of resistance (ABR) and a Drug Resistance Index (DRI). Using the Global Database for Tracking Antimicrobial Resistance (TrACSS) to construct an index of national action, we apply cross-sectional regression across 73 countries to estimate the association between the level of action in 2016 and trends in national indicators (2000-2016). We find that national action is consistently associated with improved linear or categorical trends in all groups of indicators. Reductions are associated with a relatively high action index (range 0-4) for ABU (median 2.8, 25-75% quartile 2.6-3.3), ABR (3.0, 2.4-3.4), and DRI (3.5, 3.1-3.6).

Shotgun metagenomics was used to analyse the microbiome and resistome of DLMs. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of domestic detergents were determined for Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and detergent tolerance and antibiotic cross-resistance were assessed. Results showed only 50% (3/6) of DLMs achieved sufficient decontamination (\u22655 log10 CFU reduction) at 60\u00b0C during full-length cycles, with rapid cycles performing inconsistently. Microbiome analysis revealed the presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Mycobacterium sp.

M2-polarized TAMs dominate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and promote EMT through cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2, IL-6, and CCL2. Conversely, EMT-transformed tumor cells reinforce TAM recruitment and M2 polarization through immunomodulatory factors such as CCL2 and ZEB1, thereby establishing a bidirectional interplay that fuels tumor progression. Current evidence on this interaction remains fragmented, and a comprehensive review of the TAM-EMT regulatory network and its therapeutic implications is lacking. This review systematically integrates the bidirectional regulatory mechanisms between TAMs and EMT, highlighting their roles in lung cancer progression.

In this study, we found that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was released into the cytoplasm through the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) in PDLSCs upon inflammation, which binds to cGAS and activated the STING pathway by promoting the production of cGAMP, and ultimately impaired the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs.

DNA hypermethylation is induced by and mediates the metabolic outcomes of high-fat diets and CVD risk-enhancing lipids in several models. Early-stage atheroma DNA is hypermethylated compared to normal adjacent tissue, and that trend is amplified as the atheroma progresses.

Although its precise cause remains unclear, recent evidence suggests that metabolic disturbances, particularly oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Oxidative stress is thought to damage melanocytes and trigger inflammatory responses, culminating in melanocyte immune-mediate destruction. Additionally, patients with vitiligo often exhibit extra-cutaneous metabolic abnormalities such as abnormal glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia, high fasting plasma glucose levels, high blood pressure, out of range C-peptide and low biological antioxidant capacity, suggesting a potential link between metabolic impairment and vitiligo development. This implies that the loss of functional melanocytes mirrors a more general systemic targetable dysfunction. Notably, therapies targeting metabolic pathways, particularly those involving mitochondrial metabolism, such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated nuclear receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) agonists, are currently being investigated as potential treatments for vitiligo. PPAR\u03b3 activation restores mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial DNA copy number and, consequently, ATP production. Moreover, PPAR\u03b3 agonists counteract oxidative stress, reduce inflammation, inhibit apoptosis, and maintain fatty acid metabolism, in addition to the well-known capability to enhance insulin sensitivity.

This study aimed to clarify the balance control mechanism improved by nGVS using detailed motion data during quiet standing. Thirty-two young healthy subjects performed quiet standing tests for 40\u202fs with their eyes closed under sham and optimal intensity stimulation. Detailed data consisting of the center of mass (COM) displacement and acceleration of the body, head acceleration, and lower and upper body accelerations were obtained from measurements using a force platform and a head inertial sensor based on the equations of motion of rigid body models. In addition, our study discusses the contributions of joint strategies for COM control and head acceleration control. The contributions of the ankle and hip strategies were calculated from the COM accelerations of the lower and upper bodies. The results indicated that the more effective group of nGVS suppressed head acceleration using the ankle strategy in the anteroposterior direction. This implies that acceleration feedback from vestibular function affects the quality of the ankle joint strategy control.

Emerging research highlights vitamin supplementation as a promising adjunctive therapy for LLD, targeting its multifactorial pathogenesis involving mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Specific vitamins, including B-complex vitamins (B1, B6, B9, B12), vitamin D, and antioxidants (C, E), demonstrate therapeutic potential through mechanisms ranging from neurotransmitter regulation to mitochondrial function enhancement. For instance, vitamin D modulates serotonin synthesis and calcium signaling, while B vitamins mitigate homocysteine-mediated neurotoxicity and support energy metabolism. Antioxidants counteract neural oxidative damage linked to depressive severity. Clinical studies reveal that vitamin D deficiency (<20\u202fng/mL) correlates with elevated depression risk, and combined B-vitamin supplementation shows symptom alleviation in nutritionally deficient subgroups. However, evidence remains heterogeneous due to variability in dosing protocols, bioavailability, and population-specific factors like comorbidities.

Vaccine acceptance can be influenced by multiple factors, which can be significantly reduced through improved vaccination promotion strategies. This study aims to identify these factors and explore potential strategies to enhance vaccine uptake among the diabetic population. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 189 patients diagnosed with type 1 or 2 diabetes. The selected patients were from the northwestern region of Romania, the largest and most significant area for diabetes treatment. We used an adapted, pretested, self-administered questionnaire developed by the authors in collaboration with other medical professionals. Participants completed a 27-item survey covering personal sociodemographics, medical history related to diabetes, comorbidities and COVID-19, level of education, religion, ethnicity, type of COVID-19 vaccine administered, and attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination, including acceptance and hesitancy. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed, with results presented as percentages and associations. The difference between groups that accepted or refused vaccination was examined using the Chi-square test, with a p-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant. If the results were statistically significant, the odds ratio (OR) was calculated with a 95% confidence interval. Results The participants were 96 (50.8%) females and 93 (49.2%) males. Most\u00a0patients, 116 (61.4%), were between 51 and 70 years old. Moreover, 56 (29.6%) had only completed high school in terms of education level. From the medical history, 186 (98.4%) had type 2 diabetes, 162 (85.7%) were taking oral antidiabetics, 94 (49.7%) had cardiovascular diseases, and 161 (85.2%) had at least one COVID-19 infection. One hundred seventy-three patients were vaccinated against COVID-19. The most common vaccine, 143 (82.7%), was Pfizer. The principal determinant for vaccine acceptance, identified by 109 (63%) participants, was individual health and the well-being of others. For those who did not choose to get vaccinated, fear of side effects (7; 43.8%) was the main reason. Regarding the administration of a third dose, the main reason for vaccine hesitancy is overcome by personal perception (22; 20.6%), while that for vaccine acceptance remains the same, i.e., individual health and the well-being of others (56; 84.8%). Vaccine acceptance had a statistically significant relationship with variables like marital status, age, orthodox religion, ethnicity, occupation, and education. Conclusions Variables such as marital status, religion, and age can positively influence vaccination uptake.

For some patients, conventional treatments, including second-generation antihistamines, omalizumab, and cyclosporine A, fail to achieve sustained control. Emerging evidence suggests that psychiatric comorbidities, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), exacerbate CSU through neuro-immuno-cutaneous (the interaction between the nervous system, immune system, and skin) mechanisms. We present the case of a 35-year-old female with refractory CSU and GAD. Despite escalating doses of omalizumab and the addition of cyclosporine A, disease control remained unstable. The introduction of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and escitalopram resulted in significant improvement, achieving complete resolution of symptoms within eight weeks.

Several factors have been identified as barriers or facilitators for translating evidence into clinical practice and behavioral changes. To facilitate a structured approach to applying these factors, we have adapted the generic theoretical domains framework (TDF) into the \"CEBO model,\" providing a practical framework for implementing evidence in clinical decision-making in the hospital department of Zealand University Hospital, Koege,\u00a0Denmark. Aim This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of the CEBO model for facilitating surgeon behavior change in an orthopedic surgery department. We will present clinical decision-making regarding the treatment of dorsally displaced distal radius fractures (DDDRF) in the elderly as an example. Methods Our department's standard of care for DDDRF in the elderly was surgical treatment. Under the evolving body of evidence, the CEBO model was applied to facilitate change in treating surgeons' behavior toward the increased use of non-surgical care. Following the four steps of the CEBO model, 1) leadership support was obtained, and relevant evidence was disseminated to all colleagues across the department; 2) stakeholders were invited to a symposium discussing best evidence and future practice; 3) conclusions from the symposium were summarized in a local clinical guideline stating non-surgical treatment as a new department standard and 4) to monitor the changes in treatment, patient charts were retrospectively reviewed from one year before and after the application of the CEBO model. Results In the first period, 95 of 120 (79%) were surgically treated, compared to 16 of 146 (11%) in the second period. An absolute decrease in the operation rate of 68% was observed.

Cancer cells can enhance their DNA repair capacity, leading to chemotherapeutic resistance. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) involves repairing DNA adducts and crosslinks caused by chemotherapeutic agents. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) pathway contributes to carcinogenesis, DNA repair alteration, and chemoresistance. However, the connection between TGF-\u03b2 pathway, NER function alteration, and resistance to cisplatin therapy remains elusive. Therefore, the objective of current study was to fill this gap by assessing the impact of TGF-\u03b2 inhibition and activation on cisplatin-induced antiproliferation, apoptosis, and DNA damage using the MTT assay, flow cytometry analysis, and COMET assay, respectively. Four NER genes, XPA, XPB, XPC, and XPF, were measured using Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). MDA-MB-231 cell line was utilized as a model of breast cancer. Blockade of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway strengthened cisplatin cytotoxicity, whereas induction of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway suppressed cisplatin cytotoxicity. In cisplatin-treated breast cancer cells, DNA damage significantly increased upon the TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibition. Conversely, cisplatin-induced DNA damage decreased significantly upon TGF-\u03b2 pathway stimulation. Finally, cisplatin caused an overexpression of the four NER genes which was curtailed and augmented by TGF-\u03b2 inhibition and stimulation, respectively.

However, the absence of targeted treatments addressing the pathological changes associated with liver injury can result in prolonged recovery and potential long-term complications. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, has shown therapeutic potential in various diseases. This prospective randomized controlled experimental animal trial aimed to evaluate the effect of HBOT on BLI in a rat model. <b>Methods:</b> We established a BLI rat model by employing a free-fall weight method. Following injury, one group received no intervention, while the other was treated with HBOT (2.5 ATA, 60 minutes per session, once daily). Liver tissue and serum samples were collected at multiple time points for histological evaluation (HE staining), apoptosis detection (TUNEL staining), proliferation assessment (Ki67 immunohistochemical staining), and measurements of liver transaminase (ALT, AST), inflammatory markers (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), and oxidative stress indicators (SOD, MDA, GSH). <b>Results:</b> The results indicated that HBOT significantly reduced liver transaminase elevation, pathological damage, and hepatocyte apoptosis while promoting hepatocyte proliferation and accelerating liver function recovery.

Although therapeutic approaches for advanced-stage patients have improved in recent years, there is still room for enhancing treatment response. Recent evidence suggests that dysregulation of nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) is associated with the development and progression of tumors. Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential therapeutic and prognostic implications of the solute carrier family 35 A (SLC35A) members in CRC. To achieve this, we performed integrative bioinformatics analysis using various publicly available databases, including GENT2, TCGA, UALCAN, cBioPortal, Kaplan-Meier plotter, The ROC plotter, GDSC, TISIDB, and TIMER. We compared gene expression profiles between CRC tumors and adjacent normal tissues, revealing that only SLC35A2 exhibited significant upregulation in tumors, while the other family members were downregulated. Additionally, higher SLC35A2 expression was found in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal tumors. Further analysis of TCGA and GEO datasets showed that patients with high SLC35A2 expression experienced poorer relapse-free survival. Next, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and the results indicated that the upregulation of SLC35A2 is linked to cellular metabolism pathways, such as MYC Targets V2, Steroid Biosynthesis, Pentose Phosphate Pathway, and TCA Cycle. Furthermore, our CRC cell models revealed the tumor-promoting role of SLC35A2 and discovered that the upregulation of SLC35A2 is associated with chemoresistance against irinotecan. Additionally, we observed a negative correlation between SLC35A2 expression and the infiltration of immune cells, particularly cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and B cells. This suggests the immunomodulatory role of SLC35A2. In summary, SLC35A2 is abnormally upregulated in CRC, and patients with high SLC35A2 expression tend to have poor relapse-free survival. This may be due to its involvement in regulating cancer cell metabolic reprogramming, promoting tumor progression, modulating the immune landscape, and influencing treatment response. Consequently, SLC35A2 could serve as a significant prognostic factor and a potential therapeutic target in CRC.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "03", "day": "29"}}, {"article_title": "Carbapenem treatment options for metallo-beta-lactamase: drug screening and dose optimization of meropenem-based combinations against NDM- or IMP-producing <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>.", "article_abstract": "The global dissemination of carbapenemase-producing <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (CPKP) has been occurring at an alarming pace, especially for the metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (MBL) group.

Mechanistically, P-Surufatinib inhibited pNENs progression by inducing ferroptosis through the suppression of HMOX1 mediated WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. <i>In vivo</i>, P-Surufatinib could obviously suppress the growth of subcutaneous tumors in nude mice and enhance the expressional level of HMOX1 in tumorous tissue. In summary, our findings reveal that P-Surufatinib can suppress pNENs progression via inducing ferroptosis through up-regulating the expressional level of HMOX1 by inhibiting WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, which provides a novel treatment method for pNENs.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "03", "day": "19"}}, {"article_title": "Brain microvascular endothelial cells differentiated from a Friedreich's Ataxia patient iPSC are deficient in tight junction protein expression and paracellularly permeable.", "article_abstract": "Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) is a rare, inherited ataxia resulting from GAA triplet expansions in the first intron of the Frataxin (FXN) gene, which encodes a mitochondrial protein involved in the incorporation of iron into iron-sulfur clusters. We previously identified decreased levels of F-actin and tight junction (TJ) proteins, which coincided with paracellular permeability in an FXN shRNA-mediated knockdown immortalized human brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMVEC) model. This premise is underexplored in the FA literature, prompting us to confirm these findings using a patient-derived iPSC model. One line each of FA patient iPSCs and age- and sex-matched <i>apparently healthy</i> iPSCs were differentiated into BMVEC-like cells. We quantified actin glutathionylation, F-actin abundance, TJ expression and organization, and barrier integrity. In the absence of dysregulated F-actin organization, FA iBMVEC exhibited a loss of 50% ZO-1, 63% Occludin, and 19% Claudin-5 protein expression, along with a disruption in the bi-cellular organization of the latter two proteins. Functionally, this correlated with barrier hyperpermeability, delayed barrier maturation, and increased flux of the fluorescent tracer Lucifer Yellow. These data indicate that decreased barrier integrity is a pathophysiological phenotype of FA brain microvascular endothelial cells. Clinically, this may represent a targetable pathway to reduce brain iron accumulation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration profiles in FA. Additionally, an investigation into other barrier systems, such as the blood-nerve barrier, blood-CSF barrier, or cardiac vasculature, may provide insights into the extra-neural symptoms experienced by FA patients.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "15"}}, {"article_title": "Genotype-Phenotype Correlations in Denys-Drash Syndrome in Children.", "article_abstract": "Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS) is a rare disease typically associated with a triad of early onset nephrotic syndromes (NS), susceptibility to Wilms tumor (WT), and genitourinary structural defects.

Here, we report the estimated prevalence and genetic diversity of novel PPV2-7 in Hungarian pig herds and the detection of these viruses in two Slovakian pig farms. For the comparative prevalence estimation, 2505 serum samples from different age groups, 218 oral fluid samples, and 111 processing fluid samples were collected from 26 large-scale Hungarian farms according to a systematic, cross-sectional sampling protocol. All samples were tested by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and the presence of at least one PPV was detected in 24 of the 26 (92%) Hungarian and both Slovakian farms, suggesting high levels of subclinical circulation in most herds. The estimated PPV2-7 prevalence in Hungary varied from 50% to 89%, with PPV4 being the least and PPV2 being the most prevalent virus. The highest detection rates were observed in oral fluid samples, indicating that this sample type is most suitable for screening PPVs, but all viruses were also detected in serum samples and processing fluids. All novel PPVs were most frequently detected in the serum samples of weaned pigs and fatteners, with slightly higher viral burden in the younger age groups.

These biases particularly affect our knowledge of sandflies, the main vector of <i>Leishmania</i> spp. and various phleboviruses, that are rarely explored in non-peridomestic habitats and in the context of multiple interactions with various hosts. To reveal the multihost/multivector network involving phlebotomine sandflies in a semiarid and poorly populated area of Spain, we sampled the sandfly community close to avian nests by means of two trapping methods (Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and sticky traps) during 3 years and identified the blood-meal source of all engorged sandflies. We detected six phlebotomine species with <i>Phlebotomus perniciosus</i>, <i>P. papatasi</i>, and <i>Sergentomyia minuta</i> being the most abundant ones. We identified 13 blood source species, with humans being the most common one, followed by <i>Coracias garrulus</i> (European roller) and <i>Sus scrofa</i> (likely wild boar). Five of the six sandfly species fed largely on wild mammals, although, three also fed on wild birds. <i>Phlebotomus sergenti</i> only fed on birds based on this analysis. <i>Phlebotomus papatasi</i> and <i>P. sergenti</i> were common visitors of bird nests suggesting an endophagic behavior. A network analysis showed a highly-connected and poorly-specialized network wherein sandflies shared most of the blood source and showed an opportunistic feeding behavior with marked anthropophilia. Our results obtained close to avian nests show that sandfly populations are maintained by various wild animals, which will greatly complicate the management and control of the pathogens they transmit to humans and domestic animals.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "12", "day": "17"}}, {"article_title": "SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in Indoor House Cats From the Lisbon Area During the COVID-19 Pandemic, 2019-2021.", "article_abstract": "The susceptibility of various animal species to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been studied extensively. Cats have garnered significant concern due to their high susceptibility and proximity to humans. This study aimed to evaluate the susceptibility and antibody response in house cats exposed to SARS-CoV-2 when human infection was spreading in the Lisbon area during the 2019-2021 period. A total of 733 serum samples were collected and characterized from cats admitted to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Lisbon (HEV-FMV-ULisboa). All samples were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-SARS-CoV-2 whole Spike and receptor-binding domain (RBD) proteins from the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate and 14.7% (108/733) tested positive, suggesting exposure to the human virus. Surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) against the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate showed that 20.4% of ELISA positive samples (22/108) harbored neutralizing antibodies against the virus. The 22 most promising serum samples were retested using ELISA and sVNT against Alpha, Delta, and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants. Notably, these samples exhibited antibodies that were capable of recognizing and neutralizing these variants. Subsequent neutralization assays confirmed that the serum samples effectively inhibited the infection process of Wuhan-Hu-1 D614G, Delta, and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped viruses. Our findings indicate that cats were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pandemic period and generated highly effective and broadly neutralizing antibodies against the virus. Although cats have not been demonstrated to significantly contribute to the spread of SARS-CoV-2, their high susceptibility to asymptomatic infection underscores the importance of investment in preventive surveillance measures.

Several different modes of ASFV transmission make it difficult to predict and prevent ASFV introduction to the free area and its spread in the affected area. Indirect transmission through contaminated surfaces could be one of the possible routes to introduce ASFV to the United States due to its high resistance on environmental surfaces and the frequency of international movements. However, there is limited knowledge about environmental samples for ASFV surveillance, when compared to clinical samples from infected pigs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop methods for better detection of ASFV DNA in the presence of four different types of organic contaminants: soil, swine feces, feed dust, and their mixture. The presence of organic contaminants negatively affected the sensitivity of ASFV DNA detection. Centrifugation and filtration were crucial for ASFV detection in environmental samples with soil and mixture, whereas filtration reduced the sensitivity of ASFV DNA detection in samples from clean surfaces and swine feces- and feed dust-contaminated surfaces. Detection of ASFV was significantly improved when sampled by the sponge stick with DNA/RNA shield when compared to the cost-effective sampling strategy, the cotton gauze with phosphate-buffered saline.

This study aimed to identify HLM-associated prognostic genes in GBM and explore their mechanisms of action. <b>Methods:</b> The presence and role of lactylation in glioma clinical tissue samples and its correlation with GBM progression were analysed through immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. Sequencing data for GBM were obtained from publicly available databases. An initial correlation analysis was performed between global HLM levels and GBM. Differentially expressed HLM-related genes (HLMRGs) in GBM were identified by intersecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the TCGA-GBM dataset, key module genes derived from weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), and previously reported HLMRGs. Prognostic genes were subsequently identified through univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analyses, which formed the basis for constructing a risk prediction model. Associations between HLMRGs and GBM were further evaluated via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. Complementary analyses, including functional enrichment, immune infiltration, somatic mutation, and nomogram-based survival prediction, were conducted alongside in vitro experiments. Additionally, drug sensitivity and Chinese medicine prediction analyses were performed to identify potential therapeutic agents for GBM. <b>Results:</b> We detected a significant increase in global lactylation levels in GBM, which correlated with patient survival. We identified 227 differentially expressed HLMRGs from the intersection of 3,343 differentially expressed genes and 948 key module genes, indicating strong prognostic potential. Notably, genes such as SNCAIP, TMEM100, NLRP11, HOXC11, and HOXD10 were highly expressed in GBM. Functional analysis suggested that HLMRGs are involved primarily in pathways related to cytokine\u2012cytokine receptor interactions, cell cycle regulation, and cellular interactions, including microglial differentiation states. Further connections were established between HLMRGs and infiltrating immune cells, particularly type 1 T helper (Th1) cells, as well as mutations in genes such as PTEN.

This fragmentation leads to disparities in coverage, delays in treatment access, and exacerbates the challenges faced by patients with rare diseases (RDs) seeking lifesaving treatments. Canada lags behind many developed countries in adopting a national strategy for DRDs.

Serum samples were collected from 3452 cattle of 453 districts, 2786 sheep of 408 districts, and 1568 goats of 271 districts using a cross-sectional study in two stages (at the district and animal level) from 2017 to 2019 and analyzed by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA). The national BTV true seroprevalences at animal level for cattle, sheep, and goats were 20.34% (95% CI: 17.76-20.82), 7.63% (95% CI: 7.17-9.56), and 8.58% (95% CI: 7.52-10.85), while the true districts-level seroprevalences were 31.53% (95% CI: 24.06-33.77), 24.41% (95% CI: 18.06-27.53), and 13.35% (95% CI: 8.59-17.98), respectively. In addition, we found that altitude and maximum temperature were identified as important factors influencing the seroprevalence of BTV in cattle, sheep, and goats. Higher altitudes above 3000\u2009m above sea level (masl) played a protective role, reducing the BTV seroprevalence. In conclusion, antibodies against BTV were detected in Peruvian domestic ruminants without clinical signs. The seroprevalence was low in the South (<10.0%), varied in the Center and North, and high (>30%) in the East (Amazon rainforest). This study lays the groundwork for identifying BTV serotypes and <i>Culicoides</i> spp. in different regions, including altitudes above 3000\u2009masl, to enhance BTV surveillance in Peru.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "01", "day": "10"}}, {"article_title": "The H5N6 Virus Containing Internal Genes From H9N2 Exhibits Enhanced Pathogenicity and Transmissibility.", "article_abstract": "The H5N6 avian influenza virus (AIV) is constantly undergoing recombination and evolution with other subtypes of AIV, resulting in various types of recombinant H5N6 viruses. However, the risk to human public health of different recombinant types of H5N6 viruses remains unclear. Recently, two types of different recombinant H5N6 viruses were isolated from chickens. One of the viruses possessed six internal genes originating from H9N2, named A/Chicken/Hubei/112/2020 (H5N6) (abbreviated 112); the other virus possessed PB2, PB1, PA, and NP originating from H5N1, while the M and NS genes were derived from H9N2, named A/Chicken/Hubei/125/2020 (H5N6) (abbreviated 125). Here, we investigated the receptor binding properties, pathogenicity, and transmissibility of the two H5N6 AIVs. The results showed that 112 and 125 could bind <i>\u03b1</i>-2,3-linked sialic acid receptor (avian-like receptor) and <i>\u03b1</i>-2,6-linked sialic acid receptor (human-like receptor). However, 125 and 112 showed different pathogenicity in mice. Mice infected with 125 lost only a slight body weight and all survived, while mice infected with 112 lost weight rapidly and all died within a week of infection. Furthermore, in the transmission experiment, 125 could only transmit through direct contact, while 112 could transmit not only by direct contact but also by aerosol. The above results indicated that 112 exhibited enhanced pathogenicity and transmissibility compared to 125, suggesting that the H5N6 virus, whose internal genes were derived from H9N2, could pose a greater threat to human health. Therefore, continuous monitoring of different recombinant H5N6 viruses in poultry should be carried out to prevent their transmission to humans.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "01", "day": "06"}}, {"article_title": "Seroprevalence of <i>Leishmania</i> spp. in Cattle Breeds of the Mediterranean Region: Effect of the Breed in the Immune Response.", "article_abstract": "<i>Leishmania</i> spp. is an intracellular obligate protozoan that causes the zoonotic disease leishmaniosis. Although the dog has always been considered the main reservoir, the number of species involved in transmission of the parasite is increasingly numerous and includes both domestic species, such as cats or horses, wildlife species, and livestock such as pigs, sheep, or cows. In the latter, the presence of <i>Leishmania</i> spp. has been detected in some countries of South America, Asia, and Africa. In Europe, and specifically in the Mediterranean region where leishmaniasis is endemic, there are no data in this regard, although cow blood has been detected in sandflies, which act as the vector for this parasite. This study analyzed the seroprevalence of <i>Leishmania</i> spp. in 75 lactating cows of three different cattle breeds (Modicana, Simmental, and Holstein) from Southern Italy, finding an overall seroprevalence of 17.33%. Cytokine serum levels related to immune response were analyzed and the presence of <i>Leishmania</i> spp. infection did not change the levels of cytokines interleukin 1<i>\u03b2</i> (IL-1<i>\u03b2</i>), IL-6, IL-10, interferon gamma (IFN-<i>\u03b3</i>), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-<i>\u03b1</i>).

This breed had medium levels of IL-6 without infection, with high levels being observed in Simmental and low levels in Holstein. Furthermore, Simmental cows showed higher levels of IL-6 with infection than without infection. These results suggest that the livestock species could play a relevant role in <i>Leishmania</i> spp. transmission in endemic regions, and with different immune responses depending on the breed.

A decision tree-Markov model was utilized to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two hepatitis E vaccination strategies, without or following screening, for swine workers aged 16-60 in China from societal perspectives, compared to no vaccination. We calculated HEV-related cases and deaths averted, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of GDP per capita. A sensitivity analysis was conducted. Additionally, we stimulated the scenarios of fully receiving 3-dose schedule, partially receiving 3-dose schedule, and fully receiving 2-dose schedule. Both hepatitis E vaccination strategies significantly reduced HEV-related cases and deaths compared to no vaccination. ICERs were estimated to be USD 11,428.16 and 9830.71/QALY averted for vaccination without and following screening, respectively, both lower than GDP per capita (USD 12,325.24, 2023). Furthermore, one-way sensitivity analysis identified the discount rate, utility in asymptomatic cases, and probability of symptomatic infection as crucial factors affecting ICER. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) showed a 47.5% cost-effectiveness probability for hepatitis E vaccination following screening, compared to 52.5% for no vaccination. Notably, vaccination following screening was cost-ineffective after age 40 and at a price of USD 138.0/dose. Additionally, fully receiving 2-dose and partially 3-dose schedules were cost-effective, regardless of hepatitis E vaccination without or following screening strategies, while fully receiving 3-dose schedule was cost-ineffective with the vaccination without screening strategy. Hepatitis E vaccination following screening would be optimal for swine workers in China. Vaccination starting at an earlier age and lower vaccine prices can improve the cost-effectiveness.

This clinical study is a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to investigate the effects of PBM on the shoulder functional recovery after proximal humerus fractures. A total of forty-two participants, aged 18-65 years of both genders, will be randomly divided into two groups: the Control group (receiving physiotherapy combined with simulated PBM) and the PBM group (receiving physiotherapy combined with active PBM).

The hypotheses are: (1) significant correlation between objective measures and subjective assessments, (2) consistency in therapist judgments, and (3) identification of objective criteria. This research aims to formalize clinical knowledge and enhance stretching interventions' applicability. Sixteen physiotherapists participated, with varying clinical experience. Straight leg raising stretching was performed on a simulated patient. Objective measures included joint angle, electromyography, and posterior thigh stiffness. Subjective evaluations were made by therapists and simulated patient using numerical rating scales. Therapists' ratings correlated positively with straight leg raising angle change and stretching duration. Simulated patient's ratings correlated positively with an integral electromyographic values of semitendinosus muscle activity but negatively with joint angle change. Regression analysis did not yield significant predictive models. Subjective evaluations may deviate from objective outcomes, highlighting the need for a better understanding of their relationship. Physiotherapists detected small joint angle improvements subjectively, but no objective predictor of this change was found. Patients' subjective evaluations did not align with objective outcomes. This suggests therapists' evaluations may be more accurate. Additional investigation into subjective evaluation criteria is warranted.

Since deoxyribonuclease I (DNase1) is a major endonuclease involved in DNA-related waste disposal, recombinant DNase1 is an important therapeutic biologic. Recently we described the production of recombinant murine DNase1 (rmDNase1) in Pichia pastoris by employing the \u03b1-mating factor prepro signal peptide (\u03b1MF-SP) a method, which we now applied to express recombinant human DNASE1 (rhDNASE1). In addition to an impaired cleavage of the \u03b1MF pro-peptide, which we also detected previously for mDNase1, expression of hDNASE1 resulted in a 70-80 times lower yield although both orthologues share a high structural and functional homology. Using mDNase1 expression as a guideline, we were able to increase the yield of hDNASE1 fourfold by optimizing parameters like nutrients, cultivation temperature, methanol supply, and codon usage. In addition, post-translational import into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) was changed to co-translational import by employing the signal peptide (SP) of the \u03b1-subunit of the Oligosaccharyltransferase complex (Ost1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These improvements resulted in the purification of ~\u20098\u2009mg pure mature rmDNase1 and ~\u20090.4\u2009mg rhDNASE1 per Liter expression medium of a culture with a cell density of OD600 =\u2009 40 in 24 hours. As a main cause for the expression difference, we assume varying folding abilities to reach a native conformation, which induce an elevated unproductive unfolded protein response within the rER during hDNASE1 expression. Concerning functionality, rhDNASE1 expressed in P. pastoris is comparable to Pulmozyme\u00ae, i.e. rhDNASE1 produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by Roche - Genentech. With respect to the biochemical effectivity, rmDNase1 is superior to rhDNASE1 due to its higher specific activity in the presence of Ca2\u2009+\u2009/Mg2\u2009+ and the lower inhibition by monomeric actin.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "29"}}, {"article_title": "Comparison of torch with electric arc casting in the lost wax technique for the cast dental stud protocol.", "article_abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the compressive strength, microstructural characteristics, and cost-effectiveness of cast dental posts fabricated using two techniques: torch casting (TC) and electric arc casting (EAC), both integral to the lost wax method. Employing an applied research approach with an experimental design, the study analyzed 40 non-precious gold (NPG) alloy cast posts, divided equally into two groups of 20 for each technique. The selection process was non-probabilistic and based on convenience, with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure precision and relevance. The results reveal a significant advantage for the EAC technique. In Essay 1, EAC posts exhibited a mean compressive strength of 206.102\u2009MPa, compared to 157.207\u2009MPa for TC posts. Similarly, in Essay 2, EAC posts showed a mean strength of 172.625\u2009MPa versus 136.303\u2009MPa for TC posts. These differences were statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05), with EAC posts also displaying smaller failure diameters and areas, suggesting better load distribution. Morphological and microstructural analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a porous surface with irregular topography in both techniques. However, EAC samples displayed crystalline growths within the copper matrix, indicating a non-homogeneous stoichiometry, while TC samples showed aluminum-enriched zones, suggesting a non-uniform elemental distribution. Chemical composition analysis via energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) identified copper (Cu) as the predominant element in both samples, with trace elements such as aluminum (Al), nickel (Ni), and iron (Fe) also present. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis further revealed distinct crystalline phases, with EAC samples exhibiting a higher proportion of Cu\u2083Zn and gamma-Fe phases compared to TC samples. A cost analysis using Python 3.13 and Monte Carlo simulation with 1,000 iterations revealed that EAC is more expensive, with a total cost per unit of 2.181compared to 1.467 for TC, primarily due to higher operational costs. The Mann-Whitney U test confirmed significant differences in cost distributions (p\u2009<\u20090.001), indicating that EAC has higher and more variable costs. In conclusion, the study demonstrates that EAC produces dental models with significantly higher compressive strength and a more refined microstructure compared to TC, enhancing restoration durability. However, its higher operational costs must be considered. These findings provide valuable information for dental professionals, particularly in low- to middle-income countries, and suggest that future research should explore additional properties such as corrosion resistance and biocompatibility to further validate the clinical applicability of these materials.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "29"}}, {"article_title": "Duality of Shehu transform with other well known transforms and application to fractional order differential equations.", "article_abstract": "Integral transforms are used in many research articles in the literature, due to their interesting applications in the solutions of problems of applied science and engineering.

These multiplicity relations have many interesting properties that make visualizations easier. The duality relations have important applications in solving the fractional order differential equations by various integral transforms.

Participants were asked about their experience of and satisfaction with the scheme, whether it matched their expectations and what they felt were the scheme's rewards and challenges. Questions were also asked about the organisation of the scheme and how it could be improved. The productivity of mentoring relationships was explored, including personal and professional development, and whether participants felt it important that mentoring takes place between people with similar characteristics. Sixteen pairs took part in mentoring, with ten mentees and four mentors completing evaluation questionnaires at 6m follow-up. Responses indicated that the scheme was helpful. All mentor and mentee responses reported personal and professional development. Mentee responses in particular reported gaining insight into career development, and both groups felt they had gained understanding about institutional ways of working. Participants rated the scheme positively and indicated they would recommend it to others. Being in mentoring relationships with women from similar backgrounds was ascribed value, as was mentor partners being empathetic. The evaluation revealed ways in which the scheme could be improved. Women from ethnic minorities working in academic medicine and health sciences can face structural barriers into leadership.

In this article, we explore the ramifications of energy price fluctuations, changes in energy efficiency, and shifts in monetary policy on the dynamic macroeconomic framework of the Korean economy during this unprecedented global crisis. Utilizing Bayesian estimation and impulse response functions, the study's findings reveal that a surge in energy prices triggered a cascade of detrimental effects, including reductions in output, investment, employment, energy consumption, real wages, investments, real monetary holdings, and loan interest rates, while simultaneously elevating the deposit interest rate. Conversely, a positive shock to energy utilization efficiency engendered multiple favorable outcomes, such as greater output, consumption, employment, energy consumption, real wages, investment, and real money holdings, along with declines in deposit and loan interest rates. In the short term, a monetary policy shock precipitated an upswing in output, consumption, employment, energy consumption, investment, real money holdings, deposit interest rates, and loan interest rates, while exerting downward pressure on real wages. In sum, integration of these findings into the existing literature on the subject in the Korean context may significantly increase the depth and comprehensiveness of the discourse, improving our understanding of the multiple impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the nation's economy.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "29"}}, {"article_title": "Soil nutrient concentrations influence micronutrient concentrations in Eragrostis curvula seeds.", "article_abstract": "Food insecurity often results in malnutrition, manifesting as micronutrient deficiencies that disproportionately affect children under five, impairing their cognitive and physical development. While staple crops supply necessary calories and basic nutrients required for life sustenance, they frequently lack essential micronutrients needed for overall health, necessitating alternative food sources to address food insecurity and malnutrition. This study investigated the potential of Eragrostis curvula seeds as a micronutrient-rich addition to existing food systems and used analyses of covariance to evaluate the influence of soil characteristics on seed nutrient concentrations between two grassland sites in South Africa's Gauteng province: Jameson Park and Kaydale. Populations of E. curvula were identified in Jameson Park and Kaydale, Heidelberg, where rhizosphere soils from selected plants and seeds were harvested for nutrient concentration and soil characteristics analysis. Eragrostis curvula seeds were rich in essential micronutrients, including phosphorus (5041.5-5921.7\u2009mg/kg), iron (72.2-145.4\u2009mg/kg), potassium (4490.5-5531.2\u2009mg/kg), zinc (44.9-65.4\u2009mg/kg), copper (8.6-10.2\u2009mg/kg), calcium (2978.4-16339.1\u2009mg/kg), magnesium (2265.7-2538.4\u2009mg/kg), and manganese (130.2-141.8\u2009mg/kg). Significant site-specific variations were observed: seeds from Jameson Park had higher potassium and calcium concentrations, while Kaydale seeds had higher zinc and iron concentrations. Soil analyses revealed no significant differences in phosphorus, nitrogen, zinc, copper, exchange acidity, or total cation concentrations between the sites. However, calcium levels were significantly higher in Jameson Park soils, while Kaydale soils showed higher potassium, magnesium, and manganese concentrations.

The primary cause of cervical cancer is human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and HPV vaccination has proven to be an effective prevention strategy. This publication discusses the implementation of the first pharmacy-based education (PBE) program realized through the project of Pharmaceutical Chamber of Serbia - \"Ask me about HPV\" which aimed at raising awareness of the general population about the importance of HPV vaccination. The program aimed to strengthen the role of community pharmacists in the HPV vaccination roll-out. A total of 250 pharmacists were selected and trained to provide information on HPV infection and promote vaccination uptake. The program aimed to counsel and to educate young adults and parents/guardians. A total of 24,327 subjects were educated during the program's implementation from February to May 2023, young adults (N=11,313) and parents/guardians (N=13,014). Data showed that only 4.9% of young adults and 6.4% of children (of the parents/guardians surveyed) in Serbia are vaccinated against HPV. The questionaries of 1,387 subjects already vaccinated were excluded from the further analysis and final analysis was performed based on the counseling of 22,941 participants. A significantly higher percentage of parents/guardians stated that they would have their children vaccinated against HPV after counseling at the pharmacy than young adults (42.3% and 34.1% respectively). On the other hand, of those respondents who stated they would get vaccinated after consulting at the pharmacy, a significantly higher number of young adults (51%), compared to parents/guardians (48%), would receive the vaccine specifically at the pharmacy. The results of the project indicate that education of the general population on the benefits of HPV vaccination is highly needed. The expected outcomes of this educational program are increased awareness of the burden of illness, improved consumer education, the potential for higher vaccination rates, and consequently a reduction in cervical cancer incidence and mortality in Serbia.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "29"}}, {"article_title": "Urban walkability through different lenses: A comparative study of GPT-4o and human perceptions.", "article_abstract": "Urban environments significantly shape our well-being, behavior, and overall quality of life. Assessing urban environments, particularly walkability, has traditionally relied on computer vision and machine learning algorithms. However, these approaches often fail to capture the subjective and emotional dimensions of walkability, due to their limited ability to integrate human-centered perceptions and contextual understanding. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained traction for their ability to process and analyze unstructured data. With the increasing reliance on LLMs in urban studies, it is essential to critically evaluate their potential to accurately capture human perceptions of walkability and contribute to the design of more pedestrian-friendly environments. Therefore, a critical question arises: can large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4o, accurately reflect human perceptions of urban environments? This study aims to address this question by comparing GPT-4o's evaluations of visual urban scenes with human perceptions, specifically in the context of urban walkability. The research involved human participants and GPT-4o evaluating street-level images based on key dimensions of walkability, including overall walkability, feasibility, accessibility, safety, comfort, and liveliness. To analyze the data, text mining techniques were employed, examining keyword frequency, coherence scores, and similarity indices between the participants and GPT-4o-generated responses. The findings revealed that GPT-4o and participants aligned in their evaluations of overall walkability, feasibility, accessibility, and safety. In contrast, notable differences emerged in the assessment of comfort and liveliness. Human participants demonstrated broader thematic diversity and addressed a wider range of topics, whereas GPT-4o had more focused and cohesive responses, particularly in relation to comfort and safety. In addition, similarity scores between GPT-4o and the responses of participants indicated a moderate level of alignment between GPT-4o's reasoning and human judgments. The study concludes that human input remains essential for fully capturing human-centered evaluations of walkability. Furthermore, it underscores the importance of refining LLMs to better align with human perceptions in future walkability studies.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "29"}}, {"article_title": "A remotely delivered exercise-based rehabilitation program for patients with persistent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (EX-CIPN): Protocol for a phase I feasibility trial.", "article_abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) is a prevalent adverse effect of chemotherapy agents that is estimated to be present in 2/3 of patients who receive neurotoxic chemotherapy.

This paper proposes a deep learning method based on a long short-term memory autoencoder (LSTM-AE) for predicting stress-strain curves of rock materials in discrete element numerical simulations. The LSTM-AE approach uses the LSTM network to construct both the encoder and decoder, where the encoder extracts features from the input data and the decoder generates the target sequence for prediction. The mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2) of the predicted and true values are used as the evaluation metrics. The proposed LSTM-AE network is compared with the LSTM network, recurrent neural network (RNN), BP neural network (BPNN), and XGBoost model. The results indicate that the accuracy of the proposed LSTM-AE network outperforms LSTM, RNN, BPNN, and XGBoost. Furthermore, the robustness of the LSTM-AE network is confirmed by predicting 10 sets of special samples. However, the scalability of the LSTM-AE network in handling large datasets and its applicability to predicting laboratory datasets need further verification.

Results showed that the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) exhibited an a \"rise-fall\" trend with the addition of NM. An optimum dosage of 2% NM is expected to bring about 71.9% and 143.5% strength gain for non-FT and FT samples, respectively. Meanwhile, the FT-induced strength reduction ratio decreased from 56.3% to 38.1% with NM content from 0 to 2%. These illustrated that NM can be very effective in improving mechanical performance and alleviating freeze-thaw damage. On the other hand, deformation modulus presented similar trends with UCS, while failure strain behaved in a reverse way. Accordingly, empirical models for UCS, as well as its relationships with modulus and failure strain, were established and validated by literature data.

Here, based on a field warming experiment in the Lhasa city, Tibet, we examined the responses of phyllosphere bacterial and fungal communities to warming and their feedbacks to the yield of spring highland barley. Warming decreased yield of highland barley by 34.04%, but increased soil temperature by 2.40\u00b0C, phyllosphere fungi species richness by 50.00%, fungi Chao1 by 37.55%, fungi phylogenetic diversity by 51.74%, and pathotroph fungi by 529.17%.

If that situation involves distylous taxa, interspecific fruit set will theoretically rely on the match of sexual organs of the different species, because distylous plants only set fruits after crosses between floral morphs that are reciprocal herkogamous (RH) and are produced in different individuals. In a Caatinga forest in NE Brazil, there are three distylous species of Erythroxylum P. Br (E. citrifolium A.St.-Hil., E. pauferrense Plowman and E. simonis Plowman; Erythroxylaceae) that overlap their flowering period and have a high similarity in floral attributes. Erythroxylum pauferrense is a rare and endemic species of the region. This study aimed to describe the distylous pattern of those three Erythroxylum species (i.e., reciprocal hercogamy, proportion of morphs in the population and breeding system) and to evaluate the reproductive isolation between them. Flowering synchrony, interspecific RH and pollination were the pre-zygotic barriers investigated, and the post-zygotic one was the fruit set after interspecific pollination experiments. The species completely overlapped their flowering periods and were pollinated by the same group of species (Apis mellifera, Tetragona sp., and Trigona spinipes). In a general matter, a low level of both intra and interspecific RH was revealed. Interspecific pollination set fruits only between E. pauferrense and E. simonis. A low level of both intra and interspecific RH was revealed for all species, except for the low-level organs of E. citrifolium. The atypical distyly observed in E. pauferrense and E simonis indicates a collapse in the distylous system and may be related to a relaxation in the interspecific incompatibility mechanism.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "25"}}, {"article_title": "Evaluation of the effectiveness of a portable device for diagnosing cataract.", "article_abstract": "Access to cataract treatment and diagnostic tools continues to be hindered by financial and logistical barriers.

Although pigs typically exhibit age-related resistance to PRV, with older pigs exhibiting milder symptoms upon infection, the recent isolation of multiple highly pathogenic PRV variants and reports of severe symptoms and even death in older pigs have garnered much attention. The GDWS2 strain isolated in this study exhibits characteristics similar to those of highly pathogenic strains. GDWS2 was isolated from the brain tissue of a 90-day-old diseased pig that exhibited severe respiratory and neurological symptoms. The pig originated from a farm that had been previously vaccinated with the Bartha-k61 strain. <i>In vitro</i> experiments demonstrated that GDWS2 induces substantial cytopathic effects in PK-15, VERO, BHK cells, and PAM. Moreover, GDWS2 formed larger plaques and exhibited higher early replication titers in PK-15 cells compared to the highly pathogenic variant strain JM isolated in China. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that GDWS2 belongs to PRV genotype II, with <i>gD</i>, <i>gE</i>, and <i>TK</i> genes showing high homology to those of highly pathogenic PRV variants.

The most frequently studied cancer types were breast cancer (n=7/45; 15.6%), lung cancer (n=7/45; 15.6%), and liver cancer (n=5/45; 11.1%). The findings indicate several deficiencies in reporting quality, as assessed by CREMLS and TRIPOD+AI. These deficiencies primarily relate to sample size calculation, reporting on data quality, strategies for handling outliers, documentation of ML model predictors, access to training or validation data, and reporting on model performance heterogeneity. The methodological quality assessment using PROBAST revealed that 89% of the included studies exhibited a low overall risk of bias, and all studies have shown a low risk of bias in terms of applicability. Regarding the specific AI models identified as the best-performing, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost were the most frequently reported, each used in 17.8% of the studies (n = 8). Additionally, our study outlines the specific areas where reporting is deficient, providing researchers with guidance to improve reporting quality in these sections and, consequently, reduce the risk of bias in their studies.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "14"}}, {"article_title": "Atopic dermatitis and lymphoma risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "article_abstract": "The relationship between atopic dermatitis (AD) and lymphoma risk remains debate.

Reproductive justice (RJ) is a framework developed from the vantage of Black women's health activists to identify and address inequitable reproductive health outcomes, consider the intersection of reproductive rights and social justice, and center the experiences of historically marginalized communities. Using the contemporary example of the federal Medicaid Sterilization Form, we highlight how the pedagogy of classroom debate can teach medical students to engage thoughtfully with the complex intersection between community population perspectives and the medical profession's advocacy for standardized provision of health services. Debate has long-standing use in education and can build core medical student communication and professionalism competencies while facilitating active learning around complex medical care topics. However, it can have limited efficacy without careful attention to the development of a psychologically safe learning environment and the inclusion of nuanced and diverse perspectives. Herein, we share our debate curriculum and demonstrate how this approach aligns with the community-developed RJ framework that recognizes systems outside medicine that contribute to reproductive outcomes. Our method encourages students to critically evaluate existing literature for authorship, representation, and community participation-a crucial practice for all students to understand the importance of equity in medical research development and healthcare.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "22"}}, {"article_title": "Effects of Pemafibrate on Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI) in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes or Ischemic Heart Disease: A 24-Week Observational Study.", "article_abstract": "Pemafibrate is a novel selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha modulator (SPPARM\u03b1) that improves lipid profile, but its effects on cardiovascular events remain unproven.

The conventional waste disposal methods are often ineffective in mitigating solid waste pollution, highlighting the need for other sustainable alternatives. This study is aimed at isolating and identifying potential waste-degrading microorganisms from Mwakirunge dumpsite in Mombasa, Kenya. A total of 16 soil samples were collected using a randomized block design. The samples were inoculated in enriched basal media containing mixed municipal solid waste and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 21 days. Microbial identification was conducted using standard morphological, biochemical, and molecular approaches. DNA was extracted using organic isolation methods, and PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene for bacteria and the ITS gene for fungi was performed. Phylogenetic analysis grouped bacterial isolates into phylum Bacillota (Firmicutes), Pseudomonadota (Proteobacteria), and Actinomycetota (Actinobacteria) that included members of the genera bacilli, <i>Pseudomonas</i>, <i>brevibacilli</i>, <i>Microbacterium</i>, <i>Ochrobactrum</i>, <i>Paenibacillus</i>, <i>Staphylococcus</i>, <i>Isoptericola</i>, and <i>Streptomyces</i>.

This research aimed to investigate the phytochemicals and potential bioactivities, such as antimicrobial, thrombolytic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antidiarrheal properties of commonly available mandarin orange (<i>Citrus reticulata</i> Blanco) peel through experimental and computational techniques. Extensive chromatographic and <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopic analysis was employed to isolate four purified compounds, which were characterized as tangeretin (A), nobiletin (B), limonin (C), and \u03b2-sitosterol (D). Furthermore, GC-MS/MS analysis detected over 90 compounds with a notable number of polymethoxyflavones, including nobiletin (29.04%), tangeretin (15.55%), artemetin (8.1%), 6-demethoxytangeretin (1.28%), sinensetin (0.95%), demethylnobiletin (0.14%), pebrellin (0.10%), and salvigenin (0.04%).

The higher prevalence of migraine in related individuals compared to the general population indicates a potential genetic predisposition; however, gene expression, which is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, can also be a major factor in the migraine susceptibility. Given the high number of Portuguese migraine patients whose diagnosis and treatment have not yet been well established, we decided to carry out a whole transcriptome analysis within a migraine Portuguese cohort. This study aims to identify potential biomarkers that could contribute to improved migraine therapy. We performed total RNA sequencing on whole blood samples from 15 migraine patients and 12 age-matched controls. Differential expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis were performed in different migraine subgroups. Finally, we performed the protein-protein interaction networks of differentially expressed genes. Gene set enrichment analysis comparing migraine patients with controls highlighted upregulated pathways linked to metabolism, and downregulated immuno-inflammatory pathways. Moreover, the groups of female migraine patients and female migraine without aura patients emphasized significant upregulated pathways, including G protein-coupled receptors signalling pathways, when compared with female controls. Interestingly, we found two important differentially expressed genes related to parathyroid hormone: <i>PTH1R</i> and <i>PTH2</i>. <i>PTH1R</i> was upregulated in female migraine without aura versus female controls, while <i>PTH2</i> was both upregulated between female migraine patients and female controls, as well as between female migraine without aura and controls.

Unlike glucose, fructose bypasses critical regulatory steps in metabolism, particularly the phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) feedback inhibition, leading to uncontrolled metabolism and increased fat storage. This review delves into the metabolic consequences of fructose consumption, including its limited role in directly stimulating insulin secretion, which affects satiety signaling and contributes to increased food intake. The small intestine initially helps metabolize ingested fructose, shielding the liver and brain from excessive exposure. However, when consumed in excess, particularly in diets high in processed foods, this protective mechanism becomes overwhelmed, contributing to metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, obesity, and fatty liver disease. The review also explores fructose's impact on the brain, with a focus on the hippocampus, a key region for memory and learning. Chronic high fructose intake has been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and neuroinflammation, all of which contribute to cognitive decline and impairments in memory and learning. Additionally, fructose-induced alterations in insulin signaling in the brain are associated with increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases. These findings underscore the potential long-term neurological consequences of excessive fructose intake and highlight the need for further human studies to assess the full spectrum of its effects on brain health. Addressing the rising consumption of fructose, particularly in processed foods, is essential for developing targeted strategies to mitigate its adverse metabolic and cognitive outcomes.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "21"}}, {"article_title": "Erratum: \"Enhanced diaphragm excursion and exercise tolerance in COPD patients through inspiratory muscle training after standardised pulmonary rehabilitation: randomised controlled trial\" Masashi Shiraishi, Yuji Higashimoto, Ryuji Sugiya, Hiroki Mizusawa, Yu Takeda, Masaya Noguchi, Osamu Nishiyama, Ryo Yamazaki, Shintarou Kudo, Tamotsu Kimura and Hisako Matsumoto. <i>ERJ Open Res</i> 2024; 10: 00035-2024.", "article_abstract": "[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1183/23120541.00035-2024.].", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "28"}}, {"article_title": "Performance of two portable exhaled nitric oxide fraction devices compared to a \"gold standard\" chemiluminescence device.", "article_abstract": "Recent guidelines for the diagnosis of asthma in schoolchildren recommend the measurement of exhaled nitric oxide fraction (<i>F</i> <sub>ENO</sub>) as part of the diagnostic algorithm.

Traditionally, open spinal fusion has been the standard approach, offering direct visualization and access to spinal structures. However, advancements in surgical techniques have led to the development of minimally invasive spinal fusion (MISF) as an alternative, aiming to achieve comparable clinical outcomes while reducing surgical trauma, postoperative pain, and recovery time. Despite these advantages, concerns remain regarding the long-term effectiveness of MISF, particularly in terms of fusion rates, complication risks, and adjacent segment disease (ASD). This review critically examines the long-term outcomes of MISF compared to traditional open fusion, focusing on key factors such as perioperative outcomes, pain relief, functional recovery, fusion success rates, and cost-effectiveness. Perioperative data indicate that MISF is associated with reduced blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and lower infection rates but may involve longer surgical times and a steeper learning curve. Long-term clinical outcomes appear comparable between MISF and open fusion, with both techniques achieving high fusion rates and significant improvements in pain and function. However, the impact of MISF on adjacent segment disease remains inconclusive, with conflicting evidence regarding its potential biomechanical advantages. Cost-effectiveness analyses suggest that MISF may offer financial advantages in the long term by reducing hospitalization and rehabilitation expenses, despite higher initial surgical costs. Nonetheless, limitations in current research, including variability in study methodologies, patient selection, and surgeon expertise, necessitate further high-quality, long-term randomized controlled trials.

This study presents linear mixed model-based approaches for MET data analysis. Ten MET grain yield datasets from national variety trials in Ethiopia were used. Randomized complete block (RCB) design analysis, spatial analysis, and spatial+genotype-by-environment (G \u00d7 E) analysis were compared under linear mixed model framework. Spatial analysis detected significant local, global, and extraneous spatial variations, with positive spatial correlations. For the spatial + G \u00d7 E analysis, increasing the order of the factor analytic (FA) models improved the explanation of G \u00d7 E variance, though the optimal FA model order was dataset-dependent. Integrating spatial variability through the spatial + G \u00d7 E modeling approach substantially improved genetic parameter estimates and minimized residual variability. This improvement was particularly notable in larger datasets, where the number of trials and the size of each trial played a crucial role for presence of spatial variability and strong GxE effects. Additionally, the genetic correlation heat maps and dendrograms provided intuitive insights into trial relationships, revealing patterns of strong positive, negative, and weak correlations, as well as distinct trial clusters. The results clearly demonstrate that linear mixed model-based approaches, especially the spatial + G \u00d7 E analysis excel in capturing complex spatial plot variation and G \u00d7 E effects in MET data by effectively integrating spatial and FA models.

A review of literature, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, was conducted to assess the effectiveness of psychological treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), and pain neuroscience education (PNE). Studies on the impact of psychological distress on pain perception, circulating inflammatory biomarkers, and neuromuscular exercises were analyzed.

However, the specific contribution of bacteria and their functional interactions with fungi in freshwater sediments have yet to be thoroughly explored. In the following study, we enriched organic matter through the addition of alder (<i>Alnus glutinosa</i>) leaves into artificial stream channels (AquaFlow mesocosms). We then investigated enzyme expression, metabolic pathways, and community composition of fungi and bacteria involved in the degradation of CPOM through metatranscriptomics and amplicon sequencing. Enzymes involved in the degradation of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose were selectively upregulated with increased organic matter. Analysis of ITS and 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that during decomposition, fungal communities were predominantly composed of <i>Basidiomycota</i> and <i>Ascomycota</i>, while bacterial communities were largely dominated by <i>Pseudomonadota</i> and <i>Bacteroidota</i>. The similar gene expression patterns of CPOM degradation related enzymes observed between bacteria and fungi indicate potential functional interaction between these microbial groups. This correlation in enzyme expression may indicate that bacteria and fungi are jointly involved in the breakdown of coarse particulate organic matter, potentially through mutualistic interaction. This study uncovers the specific enzymatic activities of bacteria and fungi and the importance of microbial interactions in organic matter decomposition, revealing their central role in facilitating nutrient cycling and maintaining the ecological health and stability of freshwater ecosystems.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "25"}}, {"article_title": "ROS-Responsive Biomimetic Nanocomplexes of Liposomes and Macrophage-Derived Exosomes for Combination Breast Cancer Therapy.", "article_abstract": "Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in women globally and it poses a major threat to women's lives and health.

Molecular genetic selection methods, including single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses, offer potential avenues for enhancing these traits. This study investigated the association between TGIF1 SNPs and litter size in thin-tailed Indonesian sheep. A total of 47 sheep were sampled, and their genomic DNA was analyzed. Bioinformatics, sequencing, and statistical analyses were conducted to identify SNPs, assess genetic parameters, and examine their association with litter size. Nine SNPs, including nonsynonymous variants, were successfully identified through targeted sequencing and Sanger sequencing within exon 3 of TGIF1. Noteworthy polymorphisms at g. 42725867\u2009G>A, g. 42725886\u2009G>A, g. 42725932 A>C, g. 42725950 A>G, g. 42726009\u2009G>A, g.42726036\u2009C>T, g.42726042 A>C, g. 42726051 A>G, and g. 42726059\u2009G>A were revealed. Genetic parameter assessments indicated moderate diversity although no significant association was observed between the TGIF1 SNPs and litter size. This lack of association highlights the potential influence of environmental factors, polygenic effects, or the need for larger sample sizes in future studies. In addition, linkage disequilibrium analysis highlighted strong interconnectivity among six of the nine TGIF1 SNPs, designating them as potential Tag SNPs.

This study aimed to evaluate <i>in vitro</i> inhibitory potential of a plant extract-based biocontrol product on the different stages of <i>P. infestans</i> lifecycle, including mycelial development and, formation and germination of infection structures (sporangia and zoospores). Non-target effects were also assessed using four fungi, three of which were isolated from the phyllosphere, and two ubiquitous bacteria. For this purpose, the formulated product (FV) and the plant extract at different concentrations (PE and CPE) were tested through bioassays. The results show that the mycelial growth of <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> was completely inhibited by the FV and less affected by the CPE. Infection structures were more sensitive to PE than mycelia, although FV was consistently the most effective inhibitor. Interestingly, at non-inhibitory doses, zoospore germination exhibited disturbances, such as an increase in abnormal germination phenotypes. Overall, PE showed significant inhibitory potential against the oomycete. FV exhibited a strong impact on mycelium, sporangia, and zoospores at very low concentrations (0.01-0.05%), suggesting an optimized inhibitory effect of PE.

Though LPG is a commercially viable source for carbon-based nanomaterials, the understanding of the effects of a LPG flame on CNF growth is very limited. Therefore, the present study is to analyze the feasibility of CNF growth in a premixed LPG flame using a one-dimensional flame at varying equivalence ratios. The effects of flame equivalence ratio on the CNF morphology and crystallinity are then analyzed systematically. In the present study, a diffusion flame was used to check the stability of the flame at different flow rates, followed by establishing a premixed flat flame of LPG. An optimum height above burner of 10 mm at which the temperature is around 650 \u00b0C was used in the synthesis process. Zirconia beads impregnated with nickel nitrate catalyst have been employed. Dense CNF growth with an average diameter of 77.9 nm was observed at an equivalence ratio of 1.8; as the equivalence ratio was reduced to 1.6, the average diameter of CNF increased by 46% to 114 nm, with amorphous carbon observed. The said observation is due to the effects of the increased flame temperature as the equivalence ratio approaches stoichiometry conditions from the rich side. This increases the nucleation rate, which in turn increases the catalyst particle size and the amount of free carbon atoms, producing CNFs with larger diameters and amorphous carbon. According to Raman analysis, the grown CNFs have a high number of defects, which may be good for applications where defective nanomaterials are desirable to improve the component performance.

Even in the absence of overt obstructive coronary artery disease or valvular heart disease, patients with MetS often exhibit adverse cardiac remodeling and myocardial dysfunction. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) are the leading manifestations of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Abnormal myocardial substrate utilization, neurohormonal activation, interstitial fibrosis, coronary microvascular dysfunction, and metabolic inflammation have all been implicated in the development and progression of adverse cardiac remodeling associated with MetS. However, despite the tremendous research produced on this subject, HFpEF remains highly prevalent in such a population. The early diagnosis of abnormal cardiac remodeling would enable optimal effective therapies to prevent the progression of the disease to the symptomatic phase. HFpEF encompasses a diverse range of pathological processes. In these patients, LVDD and elevated left ventricular filling pressure are the primary manifestations. Echocardiography remains the popular imaging modality for the assessment of LVDD and LV filling pressure.

The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), with an optimal diagnostic cutoff score greater than 14, has been identified as the most accurate for diagnosing depression in ESRD, while emerging tools such as vacancy-driven high-performance metabolic assays show promise for evaluation. Depression contributes to adverse health outcomes by increasing risks of treatment withdrawal, suicide, and cognitive impairment, as well as serving as a predictor of mortality and poor treatment adherence.

This study explores three-dimensional (3D) proximal femoral morphology in DDH and BDDH and examines their distinctions from normal hips (NH), emphasizing new correlations between femoral parameters and hip instability. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 130 hips from 120 patients categorized as DDH (lateral center-edge angle (LCEA) < 20\u00b0), BDDH (20\u00b0-25\u00b0), or NH (>25\u00b0). Detailed 3D analyses using advanced CT imaging measured unique femoral parameters such as femoral neck anteversion (FAV), lesser trochanter version (LTV), and femoral head morphology. Statistical methods assessed differences among groups and identified novel correlations. Results The study confirmed that DDH is associated with increased FAV and decreased LTV, alongside reduced femoral head-lesser trochanter distance (FH-LT) and an elliptical femoral head. BDDH displayed intermediate morphological changes, highlighting its biomechanical significance. Correlations revealed new insights into the relationship between hip morphology and clinical symptoms. Discussion External rotational abnormalities, such as increased FAV and decreased LTV, may predispose DDH patients to ischiofemoral impingement, psoas bursitis, and joint degeneration. The shortened FH-LT and elliptical femoral head further contribute to instability and early osteoarthritis. These findings underscore the role of 3D proximal femoral morphology in DDH biomechanics and clinical symptoms.

Platelets get consumed in an atherosclerotic blood vessel (artery) soon after the rupture of atherosclerotic plaque, which can result in the release of larger immature platelets from bone marrow. The primary objective of this study was to determine the clinical utility of immature platelet fraction (IPF) as a biomarker in the diagnosis of ACS. As secondary objectives, we tried to determine the association between mean platelet volume (MPV) and IPF in the diagnosis of ACS and to determine the role of IPF in differentiating single vessel disease (SVD), double vessel disease (DVD), and triple vessel disease (TVD). Materials and methods A pilot study was conducted with 15 samples, and the sensitivity of IPF (90%) to diagnose ACS was obtained with a 95% confidence interval and 10% allowable error; the overall minimum sample size came to 53 (including a minimum 35 ACS). Fifty-four patients with chest pain, including patients who presented to the emergency room (ER) and who got admitted in the ward and critical care unit (CCU), satisfying the inclusion criteria, were included in the study. Statistical analysis was done using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20 (IBM Corp.,\u00a0Armonk, NY). The results are given in mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD for all the continuous variables and in frequency (percentage) for categorical variables. The normality of the data was checked by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z test. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to find an ideal cut-off of IPF for the diagnosis of ACS with respect to ECG and cardiac enzymes. Diagnostic measures such as sensitivity and specificity were applied. To test the statistical significance of the difference in the proportion of IPF and MPV with ACS, the Chi-square test was used, and the same test was used to differentiate SVD, DVD, and TVD using IPF with respect to coronary angiogram (CAG). Pearson's correlation coefficient was applied to find the correlation of IPF with MPV and platelet count, and its statistical significance was checked by linear reg t test. Results Among the 54 participants, 38 (70.4%) were diagnosed with ACS, while 16 (29.6%) were found to have non-cardiac chest pain. The ROC curve was plotted, and a cut-off value of 1.7250% was determined for IPF with a sensitivity of 94.7% and a specificity of 93.7%. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.984, with a standard error of 0.014 (p < 0.001). There was a strong positive correlation between IPF and MPV (r = 0.731, p < 0.001) in ACS patients.

This article explores whether fasting, either intermittent or prolonged, can be a viable standalone treatment for cancer or if its therapeutic potential lies in its adjunctive role. Current research suggests that fasting induces a metabolic shift, which may inhibit cancer cell proliferation by depriving them of essential nutrients. Additionally, fasting has been shown to enhance the body's stress resistance, promote autophagy, and possibly make cancer cells more vulnerable to standard treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, the application of fasting as a sole treatment for cancer remains controversial and lacks substantial clinical validation. While animal models and in vitro studies indicate promising results, the translation to human trials is complex, with various types of cancer responding differently to dietary interventions. Moreover, concerns about malnutrition, loss of muscle mass, and the overall health of cancer patients undergoing fasting without supervision must be addressed. The paper critically examines the myth and reality surrounding fasting as a cancer treatment, reviewing key studies and clinical trials to provide a comprehensive understanding of its efficacy and safety. While fasting may hold promise as a supportive therapy, particularly in combination with traditional treatments, there is currently insufficient evidence to support its use as a primary treatment modality. Further research is needed to establish the parameters in which fasting might be beneficial, such as specific cancer types, patient populations, and optimal fasting regimens. Thus, while the idea of fasting as a cancer breakthrough is compelling, it remains a complementary approach rather than a standalone solution in oncology.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "03", "day": "29"}}, {"article_title": "Oncolytic adenovirus H101 enhances the anti-tumor effects of PD-1 blockade via CD47 downregulation in tumor cells.", "article_abstract": "To investigate the anti-tumor effects of an E1B55KD-deleted oncolytic adenovirus, H101, in combination with a humanized anti-PD-1 (Programmed cell death protein 1) monoclonal antibody, Camrelizumab.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "18"}}, {"article_title": "A review on pathobiology of circulating tumour plasma cells: The sine qua non of poor prognosis in plasma cell neoplasms.", "article_abstract": "Circulating plasma cells (CPCs) in patients of plasma cell neoplasm have been an area of intense research in recent decades. Circulating tumor plasma cells (CTPCs) might represent a sub-clone of tumor cells that have exited into peripheral blood as a result of the dynamic interactions between the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment and neoplastic plasma cells. Chemokine receptors like chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and integrins are known to play a role in homing and migration of plasma cells (PCs). The hypoxic microenvironment in the BM niche also contributes to their circulation through various mechanisms. In addition, the CCL3-CCR1 axis probably competes with the retention signals from the CXCR4-\u03b14\u03b21 (VLA-4) interaction and actively promotes the exit of PCs from the BM. CTPCs, even in extremely low numbers, can be detected and quantified by high-sensitivity techniques like multi-color flow cytometry and next-generation sequencing. High load of CTPCs noted in patients of plasma cell neoplasm; monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), multiple myeloma (MM) is a strong predictor of shorter progression free survival (PFS) as well as overall survival (OS). In newly diagnosed patients of MM, a load of CTPCs correlates with the outcomes, i.e., OS and PFS. With more studies collaborating on the results of previous reports, assessment of the burden of CTPCs may become a complimentary approach for non-invasive risk stratification of MM patients and evaluating the response to therapy. Future research on larger cohorts and longer follow-ups may help to improve the existing staging system by incorporating the load of CTPCs as one of the prognostic indicators. Further studies based on isolation and genetic characterization of CTPCs may help in understanding the pathophysiology of the progression of the disease and may open avenues for newer treatment modalities.

In forensic settings, critical workforce shortages combined with increased workloads further threaten sustainability of the practice. Postmortem imaging (PMI) can help mitigate these ongoing problems. Postmortem computed tomography can help clarify manner and cause of death in a variety of situations and has undeniable advantages, including cost reduction, the potential to review data, expedient reporting, archived unaltered enduring evidence (available for expert opinion, further review, demonstrative aids, and education), and (when feasible) adherence to cultural and religious objections to autopsy.

This study focuses on describing and comparing the genomic features of gammachloroviruses, previously referred to as SAG-viruses. We present 24 novel isolates capable of forming plaques on lawns of Chlorella heliozoae SAG 3.83, including the first giant virus isolated from Greenland. Together with 13 previous isolates, these new viruses form a robust dataset that we used to investigate the genomic landscape and to test whether environmental conditions influence the species diversity of gammachloroviruses. Genome sizes range from 283 kbp to 385 kbp, with one new isolate having the smallest genome found in the genus Chlorovirus. Based on phylogenomics and global genome identity analysis, we defined 10 species of \"Gammachlorovirus\", half of which are represented by a single isolate. We observed a high level of genome synteny, and the tRNA islets maintain a distinct interspecific pattern, although some notable variations are evident. Our analysis reveals an open pan-genome composed of 681 COGs, more than 30% of which consist of uncharacterized genes, highlighting significant innovative genetic potential for these viruses. Our results suggest that the subgenus \"Gammachlorovirus\" exhibits the greatest genetic diversity among chloroviruses, with variability that is independent of geographic location. Overall, these findings underscore the considerable diversity within these ten newly defined species and the importance of isolating and characterizing chloroviruses from new locations worldwide to enhance our understanding of the ecology and evolution of this group of giant algal viruses.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "02", "day": "22"}}, {"article_title": "Reduced cross-protective potential of Omicron compared to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 spike vaccines against potentially zoonotic coronaviruses.", "article_abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasised the importance of vaccines and preparedness against viral threats crossing species barriers.

However, due to their different grades and formats, the attractions of similar facilities of the same size to residents vary considerably. Therefore, this paper constructs a comprehensive index of POI (Point of Interest) facility quality to reflect the influence of the number of facilities and preferences on bicycle trips. In addition, two types of riding safety indicators, namely the proportion of non-isolation bars and the proportion of non-motor vehicle lane parking, are added to the road safety facilities. On this basis, GWR and GTWR models are established to explored the temporal and spatial distribution characteristic of cycling, and identifies the relationship between cycling behavior and built environments based on 2022 Daily Trip Survey in Xianyang, China. The model results demonstrate the following: (1) The GTWR model exhibits a better fit compared to the GWR model. (2) There are significant differences between the urban central area and the marginal area, which verifies that similar facilities have diverse impacts on the cycling frequency in distinct regions. (3) The promoting or inhibiting effects of the urban built environment on the cycling frequency are highly congruent with the temporal characteristics of commuting, and these effects typically reach their maximum during commuting rush hours.

This study uses descriptive and inferential statistics to evaluate the impact of these interventions. Crash data between 2014 and 2021, excluding 2017 when the measures were implemented, is used in the analysis.

Notable speed drops were observed at humps in some road segments while humps had no appreciable effect on speed in others. This underscores the need for additional measures or other approaches to reduce the operating speed of buses and trucks. The equivalent crash number for pedestrian crashes reduced by 24.45% and total crashes dropped by 51.14%.

Stool samples were collected from febrile children, with or without diarrhea, who visited healthcare facilities. The study included 42 laboratory-confirmed NTS-positive cases and 42 NTS-negative children from the same community. Environmental samples, including drinking water, open drains, soil, and household effluent, were collected from both case and control households, in addition to raw sewage from main sewer-line convergence points. Conventional microbiological culture and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction techniques were employed for NTS detection, with genomic sequencing used for strain characterization. Environmental samples from case households showed a higher NTS contamination rate of 33.3% (42/126) compared to control households of 7.2% (9/126). Higher odds of NTS infection in children were associated with household environmental factors, particularly exposure to household effluent (OR = 7.7, 95% CI: 2.18-34.82, p = 0.0005), drinking water (OR = 6.4, 95% CI: 1.57-37.76, p = 0.0055), and soil (OR = 5.4, 95% CI: 1.01-54.28, p = 0.0485).

In consultation with World Health Organization's Regional Advisors, program managers, government officials, and clinicians involved in the implementation of HPV testing-based cervical cancer screening programs were invited to participate in semi-structured, in-depth, interviews. Interview notes and transcripts were used for inductive analysis, focusing on responses to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on screening programs. Thirty-two interviews were conducted with participants between the age of 29 and 61 years, representing programs from 25 countries. Six key themes were noted. Regarding disruptions, (1) the entire cancer continuum was affected, leading to delays or, in some cases even cessation of vaccination, screening, and treatment programs; and (2) a heightened sense of fear around contracting and transmitting COVID-19 shifted government priorities and impacted healthcare delivery. Nonetheless, participants noted constructive ways in which programs leveraged the impact of the pandemic: (1) at the community level, participants were able to leverage an increased understanding and acceptance surrounding the importance of preventive health behaviors; (2) for HPV-testing: molecular laboratories became well-equipped with better technician training, increasing overall HPV-testing capacities; (3) the pandemic promoted virtual healthcare systems; and (4) for planning: shutdowns allowed time to plan for program scale-up. In many ways, the pandemic response provided evidence supporting countries' abilities to mobilize resources.

However, policy shifts in the United States(US) aimed at realigning foreign aid with US national interests have introduced significant uncertainty regarding PEPFAR funding in 2025, threatening to undermine decades of progress in the global HIV/AIDS response. Many countries that have long relied on PEPFAR funding are trapped in a cycle where sustained donor aid has limited their transition to self-reliant, country-led HIV programs. We leverage historical institutionalism to examine how past structures, especially colonial-era institutions, have constrained African nations and limited their capacity for self-determination through the phenomenon of path dependency. Foreign aid, often aligned with the geopolitical and economic interests of donor nations, has further undermined institutional resilience in aid-recipient countries. The recent halt in PEPFAR funding, marks a critical juncture in global health, with the potential to catalyze long-overdue systemic reforms in African health systems. As uncertainty around U.S. foreign aid grows, we anticipate an increase in engagement from private and philanthropic funders. Without corrective action, the persistence of inefficient institutional pathways will continue to undermine the impact of financial investments in many African institutions, jeopardizing the effectiveness and sustainability of initiatives aimed at improving national health outcomes. For sustainable reforms in former colonies, countries must first acknowledge the constraints of colonial legacies, decolonize mindsets and institutions, define their own development priorities, and establish transparent, accountable governance, alongside political stability as fundamental pillars for progress. PEPFAR is the first major global health program to be affected, and it is unlikely to be the last.

However, excessive copper exerts cytotoxic effects through multiple pathways, including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, apoptotic cascade activation, necrotic membrane rupture, inflammatory responses, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Distinct from other cell death mechanisms, cuproptosis is characterized by copper ion binding to acetylated mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins, leading to pathogenic protein aggregation, iron-sulfur cluster depletion, and cellular collapse. Emerging evidence underscores aberrant copper accumulation and resultant proteotoxic stress as pivotal contributors to the pathogenesis of multiple musculoskeletal pathologies, including osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, sarcopenia, osteosarcoma, intervertebral disc degeneration, spinal cord injury, and biofilm-associated orthopedic infections.

The results suggest that Survivin plays a definitive role in maintaining the normal homeostasis of oral mucosa. The gradual upregulation and downregulation of SSL in OL and OSCC can be used to predict the aggressive nature of the malignancy.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective, anticonvulsant, and anti-anxiety effects of piracetam in the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) seizure rat model. To evaluate the anticonvulsant properties of piracetam in the PTZ seizure model, the experimental groups were administered piracetam at doses of 30 or 100 mg/kg.

The anti-anxiety effects were evaluated using the elevated plus maze and open field tests. Additionally, the antioxidant effects of piracetam on brain tissues were examined. The open field test results demonstrated a significant increase in the number of crossings over the line in the Piracetam (30 and 100 mg/kg) and diazepam groups, in comparison to the negative control group. In the plus maze test, the groups administered Piracetam demonstrated a greater tendency to spend time in the open arms than the control group. Furthermore, diazepam markedly elevated the time spent in the open arms in comparison to the negative control group.

Piracetam demonstrated anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects in PTZ-induced epileptic rats, exhibiting the ability to inhibit or reduce the incidence of seizures. Additionally, it demonstrated anti-anxiety and sedative properties. The neuroprotective effects of Piracetam may be attributed to its ability to regulate neurotransmitter systems, including cholinergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and glutamatergic pathways.

This research aims to identify key genes associated with autism spectrum disorder using a hybrid deep learning approach. To achieve this, a protein-protein interaction network is constructedand analyzed through a graph convolutional network, which extracts features based on gene interactions. Logistic regression is then employed to predict potential key regulatorgenes using probability scores derived from these features. To evaluate the infection ability of these potential key regulator genes, a susceptible-infected (SI) model, is performed, which reveals the higher infection ability for the genes identified by the proposed method, highlighting its effectiveness in pinpointing key genetic factors associated with ASD. The performance of the proposed method is compared with centrality methods, showing significantly improved results. Identified key genes are further compared with the SFARI gene database and the Evaluation of Autism Gene Link Evidence (EAGLE) framework, revealing commongenes that are strongly associated with ASD. This reinforces the validity of the method in identifying key regulator genes. The proposed method aligns with advancements in therapeutic systems, diagnostics, and neural engineering, providing a robust framework for ASD research and other neurodevelopmental disorders.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "22"}}, {"article_title": "RAGing ahead in rheumatology: new language model architectures to tame artificial intelligence.", "article_abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly transforming rheumatology with research on disease detection, monitoring, and outcome prediction through the analysis of large datasets. The advent of generative models and large language models (LLMs) has expanded AI's capabilities, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as question-answering and medical literature synthesis. While NLP has shown promise in identifying rheumatic diseases from electronic health records with high accuracy, LLMs face significant challenges, including hallucinations and a lack of domain-specific knowledge, which limit their reliability in specialized medical fields like rheumatology. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) emerges as a solution to these limitations by integrating LLMs with real-time access to external, domain-specific databases. RAG enhances the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses by retrieving pertinent information during the generation process, reducing hallucinations, and improving the trustworthiness of AI applications. This architecture allows for precise, context-aware outputs and can handle unstructured data effectively. Despite its success in other industries, the application of RAG in medicine, and specifically in rheumatology, remains underexplored. Potential applications in rheumatology include retrieving up-to-date clinical guidelines, summarizing complex patient histories from unstructured data, aiding in patient identification for clinical trials, enhancing pharmacovigilance efforts, and supporting personalized patient education. RAG also offers advantages in data privacy by enabling local data handling and reducing reliance on large, general-purpose models. Future directions involve integrating RAG with fine-tuned, smaller LLMs and exploring multimodal models that can process diverse data types. Challenges such as infrastructure costs, data privacy concerns, and the need for specialized evaluation metrics must be addressed. Nevertheless, RAG presents a promising opportunity to improve AI applications in rheumatology, offering a more precise, accountable, and sustainable approach to integrating advanced language models into clinical practice and research.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "21"}}, {"article_title": "Deep Brain Stimulation for Post-Hypoxic Myoclonus: A Case Correlating Local Field Potentials to Clinical Outcome.", "article_abstract": "Post-hypoxic myoclonus (PHM) is characterized by generalized myoclonus after hypoxic brain injury.

In Africa, there are about 28.5 million people of all ages living with HIV/AIDS, of whom 2.2 million died of AIDS due to multiple factors that overlap, severe household food insecurity including inadequate food diversity, food intake less than three times a day, body mass index (BMI) of less than 18\u2009kg per square meter, and inadequate food intake. Good nutrition is important for people with HIV because it helps strengthen the immune system and keeps people with HIV healthy and helps absorb HIV medicines. In sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia, the high prevalence of starvation or famine exacerbated HIV/AIDS patients' mortality rates. National data from Ethiopia show that nearly 90% of HIV/AIDS-infected people are affected by food insecurity. The current study aimed to assess the magnitude, determinant factors, and coping strategies of food insecurity among adult people living with HIV/AIDS. <b>Methods:</b> An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 421 adult HIV positives who were attending antiretroviral treatment at public health facilities in both rural and semiurban areas. The study subjects were selected by a simple random sampling technique. A pretested, semistructured questionnaire was used. A bivariate and multivariate logistic regression model was fitted to identify the independent factors associated with food insecurity. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated to measure the strength of the association. <b>Results:</b> Food insecurity was prevalent among 80.3% of HIV/AIDS patients in the study population. Living in a rural area, the presence of another family member with HIV, inadequate dietary diversity, low frequency of meals, and current high viral load in the last 12\u2009months were some of the factors that significantly affect food insecurity among AIDS patients. Eating less preferred foods and reducing the number of meals were among common coping strategies. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study analyzed the overall magnitude of food insecurity among HIV/AIDS patients and found it to be higher, which may end up in a shortening of life expectancy.

In TROPION-Lung01, Dato-DXD was studied in metastatic NSCLC patients who were previously treated and showed an objective response rate of 26.4% (Dato-DXd). Other trials, including TROPION PanTumor 02, ICARUS - Lung 01, and TROPION Lung 05, showed comparable results. Dato-DXd used along with pembrolizumab, with or without systemic chemotherapy, in TROPION Lung 02 with promising efficacy results. The most common any-grade treatment-emergent adverse events were stomatitis, nausea, and hair loss, mostly grade 1-2. There are several clinical trials in the pipeline using Dato-DXd in the front-line metastatic setting and resectable NSCLC patients. Dato-DXd is currently pending approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If approved, datopotamab deruxtecan will be the first TROP2-directed antibody-drug conjugate for non-small cell lung cancer.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "23"}}, {"article_title": "Noninvasive 3D-head-scan used for 3D-printed customized helm by patient undergoing decompressive hemicraniectomy.", "article_abstract": "Decompressive hemicraniectomy (DC) is a procedure used to treat elevated, therapy-refractory intracranial pressure.

They are synthesized de novo in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently undergo various enzymatic modifications in different organelles, giving rise to a diverse range of biologically active compounds. These molecules play a critical role in regulating cell growth, senescence, migration, apoptosis, and signaling. In recent years, the sphingolipid metabolic pathway has been recognized as a key factor in heart failure (HF) pathophysiology. Abnormal levels of sphingolipid metabolites, such as ceramide (Cer) and sphingomyelin (SM), contribute to oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, ultimately promoting cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Conversely, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) regulate vascular function and influence cardiac remodeling. Additionally, enzymes such as diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) and sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase 1 (SGPL1) modulate cardiac lipid metabolism. Given their role in HF progression, monitoring sphingolipid alterations offers potential as valuable biomarkers for assessing disease severity, prognosis, and diagnosis. Given the complexity of sphingolipid metabolism and its involvement in diverse regulatory biological processes, a comprehensive understanding of its roles at both the cellular and organismal levels in physiopathology remains incomplete. Therefore, this review aims to explore the physiological functions, regulatory mechanisms, and therapeutic potential of sphingolipid metabolism. It will summarize the specific molecular mechanisms driving key pathological processes in HF, including ventricular remodeling, myocardial fibrosis, vascular dysfunction, and metabolic disorders.

A 59-year-old woman presented with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and was diagnosed with a 42 mm saccular abdominal aortic aneurysm, which was urgently repaired under the presumption of impending rupture. Intraoperatively, we found the aneurysm to be notably more fragile than a typical abdominal aortic aneurysm, while the rest of the aorta appeared healthy. This discrepancy raised suspicion of an atypical lesion, prompting us to resect the aneurysm and submit it for pathology. Subsequent immunohistochemical staining confirmed angiosarcoma, enabling timely referral for oncological management.

Methodology This service evaluation\u00a0analysed 157 ACL reconstructions at a major UK teaching hospital from 2019 to 2023. Procedures were categorised as isolated ACL reconstruction, ACL with meniscal repair, ACL with LET, or ACL and combined procedures. A multiple regression analysis evaluated predictors of operative time while assessing perioperative outcomes and readmission rates. Results Age independently predicted shorter operative times (-0.696 minutes/year, p = 0.005). LET procedures exhibited longer operative times but were mainly performed on younger, lower body mass index patients. An American Society of Anesthesiologists III status had an impact on the length of stay (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.440, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.276-0.704, p = 0.001), and ACL + LET procedures (HR = 0.466, 95% CI = 0.250-0.866, p = 0.016) were associated with significantly prolonged stays.

The choice of technique, however, is determined by many factors, including fracture type, patient characteristics, and surgeon preference. This systematic review compares the clinical and functional outcomes of surgical techniques for capitellar fracture repair. Factors influencing the selection of surgical approach are also reviewed, including fracture complexity, patient demographics, and bone quality. To perform a systematic literature search, we followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and searched the major databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science.

Clinical or biomechanical outcomes of capitellar fracture fixation using different surgical techniques were included, including fixation stability, range of motion, healing rates, and complication rates. In detail, three foundational studies were analyzed in depth, with the use of Herbert screws, Kirschner wires, and buttress plating. Clinical trials suggest that Herbert screws enable earlier mobilization and improved functional outcomes, particularly in younger patients with Type I fractures. Biomechanical studies, such as those using HCS\u00a0with buttress plating, indicate enhanced stability, especially in osteoporotic bone conditions. Factors such as patient age, bone quality, and fracture pattern appear to influence the choice of surgical technique.

However, its application in cervical esophageal cancer is limited due to anatomical challenges, such as the restricted maneuverability of standard endoscopes and difficulty in achieving stable and perpendicular laser irradiation. This study introduces a modified PDT technique using a thin endoscope with a customized attachment for lesion stabilization and precise laser targeting. The attachment, wrapped in black plastic tape, facilitated perpendicular irradiation and reduced laser scattering. Two cases of recurrent cervical esophageal cancer after CRT were successfully treated with this method. The first patient had a 10-mm, 0-IIc+IIa, cT1b lesion with severe stenosis, necessitating the use of a thin endoscope. PDT was performed with 600 J irradiation, achieving complete local control without complications, with no recurrence over four years. The second patient had a 20-mm, 0-IIa, cT1b lesion and was treated with 800 J irradiation, resulting in complete local control within three months and no recurrence at one year. Despite these promising results, this modified PDT technique has several limitations. The small sample size (two cases) limits generalizability, and long-term outcomes beyond the current follow-up period remain unknown. Additionally, the technique requires specialized equipment and expertise, potentially limiting its widespread adoption. This study presents a novel modification of PDT\u00a0using transnasal thin endoscopy for precise targeting of cervical esophageal cancer lesions. This approach minimizes laser scattering and enhances procedural accuracy. We report two cases with complete local control and no recurrence over one to four years.

Method In this prospective observational study, 50 preterm infants (<34 weeks GA at birth or <2000 gm BW) in the Neonatal Care Unit were screened for ROP from June 2021 to June 2022. All infants were assessed weekly for postnatal weight gain during the first six weeks of life and the results were correlated with the severity of ROP. Result Out of 50 preterm infants, 25 (50%) developed ROP, and 25 (50%) had no ROP. Type 1 ROP was identified in two (8%) preterm infants. The mean gestational age and birth weight for the ROP group were 29.98 \u00b1 1.80 weeks (SEM 95% CI) and 1161.32 \u00b1 340.55 gm (SEM 95% CI), which were lower than those of the No ROP group, which had 31.94 \u00b1 1.71 weeks (SEM 95% CI) and 1359.80 \u00b1 313.52 gm (SEM 95% CI), respectively. The change in weight (grams) between the ROP and No ROP groups was statistically significant each week, except for the first week. However, for the first six weeks, no statistical correlation was found between Type 1 ROP and Type 2 ROP regarding weight change. Conclusion This study posits that postnatal weight gain, particularly evident in the fourth week, may be a pivotal factor in predicting the onset and severity of ROP in preterm infants.

However, owing to the rarity of these tumors and the diversity of histological types, most treatment results are reported in clinical trials, and real-world data on the long-term treatment effects of radiotherapy in Japan are scarce. This study investigated the long-term outcomes of pediatric brain tumor treatment at a single institution. A total of 54 pediatric brain tumor patients aged \u226414 years who had undergone radiotherapy between 2007 and 2021 were included. Irradiation was performed using three-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated radiation therapy. The distribution of each tumor type was as follows: eight diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, six malignant gliomas, 12 medulloblastomas, eight ependymomas, 15 germ cell tumors, and five other tumors (malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, pinealoblastoma, atypical teratoma/rhabdoid tumor, primitive neuroectoderm tumor, and malignant astroblastoma). The median follow-up duration for all patients and survivors was 48.4 months and 110 months, respectively.

The objective of the current study is to investigate the modulation of red blood cell (RBC) lifespan by PA. Hemolytic and eryptotic markers were evaluated in the presence and absence of PA by photometric and flow cytometric methods. PA demonstrated a dual effect on hemolysis in which it was pro-hemolytic in isotonic media but anti-hemolytic under hypotonic challenge. PA also induced RBC senescence with reduced AChE activity. In addition, treated cells tested positive for annexin-V and Fluo4 and had a significantly lower forward scatter signal. Notably, ATP-replenished cells showed significantly enhanced chemoresistance against PA toxicity, which was also alleviated by ascorbic acid, L-NAME, SB203580, D4476, and necrosulfonamide.

The experts compared the results with the literature and graded them according to the level of evidence. For small renal masses (SRMs; less than 4\u2009cm), biopsy is indicated for specific/select cases, and when intervention is needed, partial nephrectomy should be prioritized. Radical nephrectomy and ablative techniques are exceptions for managing SRMs. Patients with small tumors (less than 3\u2009cm), slow tumor growth, or a risk for surgery may benefit from active surveillance. Localized carcinoma up to 7\u2009cm in diameter should be treated preferably with partial nephrectomy. Lymphadenectomy and adrenalectomy should be performed in locally advanced cases if involvement is suspected by imaging exams. Patients with venous tumor thrombi usually require surgical intervention depending on the extent of the thrombus. Neoadjuvant therapy should be considered for unresectable cases. Even in the era of targeted therapy, cytoreductive nephrectomy still has a role in metastatic disease. Metastasectomy is indicated for most patients with resectable disease.

Among viruses that infect grapevines (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) and prunuses (<i>Prunus</i> spp.), carnation ringspot virus, peach rosette mosaic virus, raspberry ringspot virus, strawberry latent ringspot virus, sowbane mosaic virus, and grapevine vein yellow virus (tomato ringspot virus) have all been designated as plant quarantine pathogens in Japan. Although these viruses can be screened using sap inoculation on quinoa (<i>Chenopodium quinoa</i>), it is difficult to identify the species based solely on symptoms. Several diagnostic tests can be applied to diagnose viral infections in plants; however, by and large, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most commonly used method. In particular, multiplex PCR allows simultaneous detection of multiple targets in a single assay, thereby reducing costs, labor, and time. Therefore, reliable diagnostic methods using PCR based on the genetic diversity of viruses are critical for detecting viral infections in fruit-tree orchards. In this study, we developed a two-step reverse transcription (RT)-multiplex PCR for quick and cost-effective detection of the six viruses listed above in infected quinoa, using newly designed primer sets.

Being seed borne and aphid transmitted virus, it important to reduce the spread and prevent its transfer to new geographical locations using rapid, specific and sensitive detection techniques. In this study, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was devised to rapidly and specifically detect BCMV. Three pairs of specific primers were designed targeting the BCMV genome.

Considerable empirical work supports this core tenet, but the field is rife with meta-theoretical issues which prevent meaningfully progressing beyond this. We describe these issues and provide a solution: an overarching theoretical framework. The two most commonly cited grounded cognition theories are <i>perceptual symbol systems</i> and <i>conceptual metaphor theory</i>. Under perceptual symbol systems, concepts are represented by integrating fragments of multi-modal percepts in a simulator. Conceptual metaphor theory involves a limited number of image schemas, primitive structural regularities extracted from interaction with the environment, undergoing a limited number of transformations into a concept. Both theories constitute important developments to understanding mental representations, yet we argue that they currently impede progress because they are prematurely elaborate. This forces them to rely on overly specific assumptions, which generates a lack of conceptual clarity and unsystematic testing of empirical work. Our <i>minimalist account</i> takes grounded cognition 'back to basics' with a common-denominator framework supported by converging evidence from other fields. It postulates that concepts are represented by simulation, re-activating mental states that were active when experiencing this concept, and by metaphoric mapping, when concrete representations are sourced to represent abstract concepts. This enables incremental theory development without uncertain assumptions because it allows for descriptive research while nonetheless enabling falsification of theories.

Mitochondria play a pivotal role in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells, and their function can profoundly influence tumor progression. Therefore, identifying mitochondrial genes with immune-related features may offer a promising new approach for prognosis in CRC. Mitochondrial-associated genes were retrieved from the MITOCARTA 3.0 dataset. The LASSO regression method was applied to identify prognostic genes, while the area under the ROC curve and nomograms were used to assess the robustness of the model. Single-sample genomic enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was utilized to explore the relationship between model genes and immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify potential therapeutic agents. Cellular assays were performed to validate the effectiveness of identified drugs. Key mitochondrial genes, including SUCLG2, ACACB, OSBPL1A, and TRAP1, have been identified as significant prognostic markers in CRC. The expression of ACACB and OSBPL1A progressively increased, while SUCLG2 and TRAP1 expression decreased in patients. ROC curve analysis of the TCGA dataset showed an area under the curve (AUC) greater than 0.6 for 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival predictions, demonstrating the strong prognostic potential of this model. Additionally, the model was strongly correlated with immune cells, particularly CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and immune checkpoint regulators. Molecular docking analysis revealed that OSBPL1A binds to dabrafenib at glycine position 747.

Mitochondria are considered the cell's powerhouse and use nutrients to produce redox potential and generate ATP and H<sub>2</sub>O through the process of oxidative phosphorylation by operating electron transfer and proton pumping. Simultaneously, mitochondria also produce oxygen free radicals, called superoxide (O<sub>2</sub> <sup>-</sup>), non-enzymatically, which interacts with other moieties and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), peroxynitrite (ONOO-), and hydroxyl radical (OH<sup>-</sup>). These reactive oxygen species modify nucleic acids, proteins, and carbohydrates and ultimately cause damage to organs. The nutrient-sensing kinases, such as AMPK and mTOR, function as a key regulator of cellular ROS levels, as loss of AMPK or aberrant activation of mTOR signaling causes ROS production and compromises the cell's oxidant status, resulting in various cellular injuries. The increased ROS not only directly damages DNA, proteins, and lipids but also alters cellular signaling pathways, such as the activation of MAPK or PI3K, the accumulation of HIF-1\u03b1 in the nucleus, and NFkB-mediated transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Then, diffraction analysis demonstrates that the performance of forward-designed couplers is hindered by spurious diffraction orders and destructive interference. To further enhance performance, an adjoint-based topology optimization algorithm is utilized to customize electric near-field, which can effectively suppress spurious diffraction orders and destructive near-field interference, achieving ultra-high coupling efficiency of 93\u202f% with 16.7\u202fdB extinction ratios at 1,550\u202fnm.

From a cohort of 211 cows, we integrated multi-omics data (metagenomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics) to identify key microbes and then utilized an in\u00a0vitro rumen fermentation simulation system and ketogenic hepatic cells to validate the potential mechanisms and the effects of postbiotics derived from key microbes. Postpartum cows with metabolic disorders compensate for glucose deficiency through mobilizing muscle proteins, which leads to marked decreases in milk protein content. Concurrently, these cows experience rumen microbiota disturbance, with marked decreases in the concentrations of volatile fatty acids and microbial protein, and the deficiency of alanine (Ala) in microbial protein is correlated with the metabolic disorder phenotype. Metagenomic binning and in\u00a0vitro fermentation assays reveal that <i>Ruminococcus_E bovis</i> (MAG 189) is enriched in amino acid biosynthesis functions and responsible for Ala synthesis.

Deficiency of SLC27A5 promotes the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is strongly associated with a poor prognosis. SLC27A5 exhibits noncanonical functions beyond its metabolic role; however, its specific mechanisms in hepatocarcinogenesis remain elusive and are therefore investigated in this study. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry analysis showed that SLC27A5-interacting proteins were significantly enriched in alternative polyadenylation (APA). RNA-sequencing data provided evidence that SLC27A5 plays a global role in regulating APA events in HCC. Mechanistically, SLC27A5 facilitates the usage of the proximal polyadenylation site of <i>METTL14</i> by downregulating the expression of the APA-associated factor PABPC1, resulting in the shortening of the <i>METTL14</i>-3'UTR and the conversion of <i>METTL14</i>-UL to <i>METTL14</i>-US. In contrast to <i>METTL14</i>-UL, <i>METTL14</i>-US escapes the inhibitory effect of miRNA targeting, leading to increased METTL14 expression. <i>METTL14</i>-US upregulation by SLC27A5 suppressed the stemness of HCC. Therefore, low levels of SLC27A5 and METTL14 may serve as reliable biomarkers for identifying poor prognosis in patients with HCC.

For the substrate in which the DKR led to optical purities lower than 90\u00a0%, solvent engineering was performed, thus being possible to obtain both atropoisomers of the final alcohol with high enantiomeric excesses by using methyl tert-butyl ether or tetrahydrofuran as cosolvents.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "03", "day": "15"}}, {"article_title": "Challenges and good practices on transaminase-catalysed synthesis of optically pure amines.", "article_abstract": "Transaminase-catalysed synthesis of chiral amines has been highlighted as an important strategy to get access to optically pure primary amines with high selectivity.

However, the extreme rarity and heterogeneity of CTCs, occurring at genotypic, phenotypic and functional levels, poses a major challenge for the study of this population and explains the lack of standardized strategies of CTC isolation. Lung cancer, the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide, is a paradigmatic example of how CTC heterogeneity can undermine the clinical utility of this biomarker, since contrasting data have been reported using different isolation technologies. Some evidences suggest that only a fraction of CTC, characterized by stem-like feature and partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, can sustain metastasis initiation. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have the potential to maintain primary tumors, initiate metastasis and escape both chemotherapy and immunotherapy treatments. Moreover, a close connection has been reported in several tumor types among hybrid phenotype, characterized by retention of epithelial and mesenchymal traits, acquisition of CSC feature and increased metastatic potential. This review focuses on the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of CTCs and the resulting implications for their isolation and clinical validation, especially in the setting of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In particular, we discuss the most relevant studies providing evidence for the presence and prognostic/predictive value of CTC subsets characterized by stem-like and hybrid EMT phenotype.

This study aimed to bridge this gap by evaluating the feasibility, acceptability, and effects of internet-delivered therapist training in A-EBT for trichotillomania. A randomized waitlist-controlled implementation trial was conducted with 119 licensed mental health providers assigned to either immediate training or waitlist cohorts. The immediate training group participated in a 1-day online workshop followed by 6 months of consultation. Compared to the waitlist cohort, the immediate training cohort showed significant improvements in knowledge of trichotillomania, its treatments, and self-efficacy in providing the therapy, which were maintained throughout the end of the consultation period. Behavioral outcomes indicated that the immediate training cohort was more likely to self-promote their ability to treat trichotillomania, leading to an increased caseload of clients with trichotillomania and other body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs). Approximately one-third of providers in both groups began treating at least one client with trichotillomania or another BFRB during the training period. In conclusion, training providers in A-EBT for trichotillomania is feasible and effective in improving provider knowledge and self-efficacy, leading to more individuals receiving evidence-based care.

One critical cognitive skill is decision-making, which requires attentional set-shifting (ATSET)-the ability to quickly assess problems, evaluate options, and select the best actions. Previous studies have shown that exposure to <10 cGy of SR ions impairs ATSET performance in animal models. However, the impact of low LET (< 1 keV/\u03bcm) protons, which significantly contribute to the total radiation flux astronauts encounter within spacecraft, on ATSET performance is unknown. To address this gap, we evaluated the effects of cranial irradiation with 10 cGy of 100 MeV/n protons (LET = 0.732 keV/\u03bcm) on ATSET performance in male Sprague-Dawley rats. We also investigated whether concurrent exposure to variable gravity (hypergravity step-up, step down, purported to have the same effect as exposure to microgravity (another major spaceflight stressor) exacerbated SR-induced cognitive deficits. Our findings indicate that proton exposure alone significantly impaired ATSET performance, as evidenced by decreased processing speed while performing compound discrimination reversal and extra-dimensional shifting. Notably, no additive or synergistic effects were observed when hypergravity was combined with proton exposure. The impact that low-dose proton exposure has on CNS functionality, particularly in reducing processing speed during complex tasks, warrant further investigation.

Growing food demand, rising population, climate change, and natural resources degradation, make it necessary to transform the current production systems towards more sustainable models. Agroecology is being promoted as one of the pathways to transition toward sustainable food production, with broad adoption requiring incentives for farmers. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines, we conducted a scoping review of 120 articles to understand the incentives applied for promoting agroecological practices, whether and how the incentives promote the adoption of agroecological practices, and their relationship with economic, environmental, and social outcomes among rice farmers in Vietnam. Such in-depth reviews of the role of incentives in the agroecological transition are scarce. Results show that in about 60% of the articles, incentives led to adoption, outcomes (e.g., yield and income gains), or both, suggesting the importance and common use of incentives among rice farmers in Vietnam. Four types of incentives used were market, non-market, regulatory, and cross-compliance. These incentives directly or indirectly influenced outcomes through the adoption of agroecological practices. Market incentives (33%) were relatively more important for directly influencing outcomes, while non-market incentives (50%) were more important for indirectly influencing outcomes. Market, non-market, and regulatory incentives were more associated with the adoption of new agronomic practices, such as farm diversification, improved varieties, and organic agriculture than with other practices, while cross-compliance incentives were more highly associated with adoption of agroforestry. Generally, the incentives used were more associated with economic outcomes (56%), than with environmental (31%), and social (13%) outcomes.

Moreover, uncontrolled seizures are associated with increased health risks and shortened life expectancy in individuals with refractory epilepsy. Preclinical studies play a\u00a0crucial role in drug discovery, and the zebrafish (Danio rerio) have been successfully employed for this purpose. In this study, we utilized the zebrafish PTZ-induced seizure model to evaluate the effects of two peptides on seizure responses: Tripeptide (p-BTX-I) and the CX2 (a Cx43derivated peptide). Zebrafish larvae at 6 days post-fertilization were pre-treated with these peptides at various concentrations, depending on their experimental groups, 24h prior to seizure induction. We assessed seizure frequency, quantified swimming activity, measured transcript levels of genes related to inflammation and apoptosis (il1b, tnfa, cox1, cox2a, il6, casp3a, casp9, baxa, bcl2a, and c-fos), and analyzed the biodistribution of both peptides. Our results indicate that the Tripeptide exhibited anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, particularly through reducing the expression of il1b and casp9. CX2 pre-treatment significantly downregulated inflammatory markers (il1b, il6, tnfa, and cox1). Biodistribution analysis confirmed that the CX2 peptide reached the zebrafish brain, suggesting a direct role in modulating seizure-related pathways. Our findings demonstrate that Tripeptide and CX2 peptides can modulate gene expression and mitigate molecular response associated with epileptic seizures in the zebrafish brain. These peptides thus represent promising candidates for future research aimed at developing novel anti-epileptic therapies.

This study investigated SLC2A2's role in liver differentiation using in silico, in vitro, and in vivo approaches. Analysis of GEO datasets (GSE132606, GSE25417, GSE67848) and TCGA HCC data revealed that while SLC2A2 expression decreases with HCC progression, stemness-associated genes, including SOX2 and POU5F1, are upregulated. Zebrafish embryos injected with SLC2A2-targeting morpholino exhibited reduced expression of the liver differentiation marker fabp10a without significantly altering the hepatoblast marker hhex. In HepG2 cells, SLC2A2 knockdown increased stemness and IGF1R pathway markers, indicating a shift toward less differentiated states. These findings suggest that SLC2A2 supports liver differentiation by regulating glucose metabolism and suppressing pathways associated with stemness and malignancy. Targeting SLC2A2 may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for liver-related diseases, particularly HCC, by addressing its dual role in differentiation and tumor progression.

Aging is associated with decreasing cognitive control and inhibition alongside improvements in emotional control and regulation. However, little is known about how aging impacts response inhibition within emotionally relevant contexts. The current study examined how aging impacts emotional response inhibition by comparing older and younger adults' ability to stop responses to emotional images. Participants completed a novel stop-signal task where pleasant and unpleasant scene images appeared on a minority of trials, while participants developed a pre-potent 'go' response during trials presenting neutral shapes. Notably, in each task block only one of the two types of emotional scene images served as a task-relevant stop cue, e.g., unpleasant images as stop-signals. Accordingly, in a given task block participants should continue to respond at the onset of the other type of emotional image (i.e., pleasant scenes as 'go-images'). Overall, older adults exhibited less efficient stopping than younger adults. However, stopping did not differ between pleasant and unpleasant images in either age group. Thus, while response inhibition is less efficient in older adults, it does not differ by emotion across adulthood. The innovative design also permitted exploratory analyses of responses to images that were not the current stop-signal, i.e., responses correctly executed for 'go-image' trials. In contrast with response inhibition on stop trials, emotion and aging significantly interacted during response execution, with older adults performing less accurately than younger adults on unpleasant go-image trials. Taken together, aging interacts with emotion only for response execution but not response inhibition for emotional scenes. This study offers new insights into the effects of aging on response inhibition in emotionally complex contexts and increases the ecological validity of response inhibition research. It also highlights the distinct effects of aging and emotion on response execution versus inhibition for task-relevant emotional information.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "09"}}, {"article_title": "Out-of-body experiences: interpretations through the eyes of those who live them.", "article_abstract": "Out-of-body experiences (OBEs) are primarily characterized by the sensation of the self being located outside one's physical body.

Functional decline in transplanted organs has stagnated over the past two decades, with most patients requiring lifelong immunosuppression, therapies that overlook the principles of self/non-self recognition and natural transplantation events in humans. To address these discrepancies, this perspective proposes that immunity evolved not as pathogen-driven but as a mechanism to preserve individuality by preventing invasion from parasitic conspecific cells. It further reveals that the concept of \"self/non-self\" recognition encompasses multiple theories with complex and often ambiguous terminology, lacking precise definitions. In comparisons, natural historecognition reactions in sessile marine invertebrates are regulated by a wide spectrum of precise and specific allorecognition systems, with transitive and non-transitive hierarchies. Using the coral Stylophora pistillata and the ascidian Botryllus schlosseri as models, it is evident these organisms distinguish 'self' from 'non-self' with remarkable accuracy across various allogeneic combinations, identifying each non-self entity while simultaneously recognizing selfhood through transitive allogeneic hierarchies. Their allorecognition offers an improved explanation for post-transplant outcomes by accounting for the natural dynamic, spatiotemporal evolution of selfhood. To bridge natural (in invertebrates and humans alike) and clinical transplantation phenomena, the 'allorecognition landscape' (AL) metaphor is proposed. This unified framework conceptualizes self/non-self recognition as shaped by two dynamic continuums of 'self' and 'non-self' nature. Throughout the patient lifespan, the AL represents diverse and transient arrays of specific 'self' and 'non-self' states (including reciprocal states) that shift over time in either recognition direction, requiring adaptable clinical strategies to address their evolving nature.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "10"}}, {"article_title": "Comparative evaluation of three anti-dsDNA antibody detection methods in systemic lupus erythematosus: insights from a large monocentric cohort.", "article_abstract": "Anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies at abnormal titer are of considerable diagnostic value for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of early initiation of this angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) therapy on in-hospital outcomes in patients enrolled in the MALEOS registry for AHFS. Objective This study aims to assess the impact of ARNI therapy on hospitalization duration and mortality in patients with AHFS and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below 40% at a healthcare institution in Cali, Colombia, between 2020 and 2022. Materials and methods A retrospective analysis was conducted using the MALEOS registry database to identify patients with AHFS and an LVEF < 40% between January 2020 and December 2022. Patients were stratified based on whether they received ARNI therapy. Mortality and length of hospitalization were assessed using multivariate Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Results One hundred and seventy-seven patients were included in this study, of whom more than 90% were Hispanic from Colombia, and 40.2% were women. In the ARNI group, 75% of patients were discharged before 12.75 days, whereas in the non-ARNI group, 75% were discharged by day 21.5. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP) was significantly reduced over time in the ARNI group, and mortality was lower in this group, with two fatal outcomes versus eight in the control group (Log-rank: 0.18). Conclusions Early initiation of ARNI therapy in patients with AHFS and reduced LVEF has significantly decreased NT-proBNP levels over time, reduced hospital stay, and improved in-hospital mortality compared to standard care.

This editorial seeks to examine\u00a0three primary normative motivations, humanitarianism, global health security, and social justice, to assess their implications in addressing global health inequities. Humanitarianism, rooted in compassion and charity, has historically aided in facilitating important interventions but risks reinforcing hierarchical donor-recipient dynamics and neglecting local expertise. A security-based rationale, driven by concerns over pandemic threats, galvanizes rapid resource mobilization yet may also perpetuate global disparities by prioritizing affluent regions. In contrast, a social justice framework advocates for systemic equity, emphasizing local leadership, mutual respect, and the dismantling of colonial legacies. Critically evaluating these motivations is important as some argue that prioritizing social justice is essential for genuine decolonization and sustainable global health interventions.

Although cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is not frequently observed during these procedures, it can result from small, often inconspicuous dural defects that may be missed during surgery. This scenario underscores the importance of careful intraoperative inspection and vigilant postoperative monitoring to ensure timely recognition and management, thereby mitigating potential adverse outcomes. A 36-year-old male patient underwent an L5-S1 lumbar discectomy for disc herniation. Eight days postoperatively, he developed severe headache, neck pain, and nausea, accompanied by CSF leakage confirmed through beta-2 transferrin testing. Computed tomography revealed significant pneumocephalus, while high-resolution MRI demonstrated a subtle dural defect. Despite no macroscopically visible dural tear during re-exploration, applying an epidural blood patch successfully resolved both the CSF leak and pneumocephalus. This case underscores the value of advanced imaging, specifically high-resolution MRI, in identifying subtle dural defects that may not be apparent during surgery. Detecting the minor CSF leakage was essential for directing subsequent management and avoiding further complications.

Herein, we report the case of a 6-year-old girl with moderate AD whose treatment was complicated by her mother's steroid phobia (TOPICOP score: 52.7). Despite detailed explanations addressing misconceptions regarding topical corticosteroids (TCS), the mother refused its use. As an alternative, we initiated treatment with delgocitinib 0.5% ointment, achieving significant clinical improvement. Within one month, the patient's eczema area and severity index score improved from 13.0 to 7.2. We reduced the concentration of the delgocitinib ointment from 0.5% to 0.25% secondary to a decreased Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score. After six months, her objective AD scores also improved. This case highlights the importance of assessing and addressing steroid phobia in parents of children with AD. Despite comprehensive education, some parents remain unwilling to use TCS, necessitating alternative treatment approaches. The use of a validated tool, such as the TOPICOP score, can help clinicians objectively assess parental concerns. In cases where TCS refusal persists, delgocitinib ointment may serve as an effective induction therapy.

Mauritius has repeatedly mass-culled an endemic and threatened flying fox species (the Mauritian flying fox; <i>Pteropus niger</i>) failing the intended objectives of crop protection and elevating the species' extinction risks. In this context, the ecology of this species should be better understood to develop non-lethal management strategies. Here we investigated foraging patterns of vertebrate frugivores over 24 hour cycles in lychee orchards and backyard gardens. We assessed all agents of damage (mainly flying fox, alien bird, alien mammal) and the temporal variation of flying fox and bird foraging (take and amount eaten relative to fruit ripeness) on lychee trees. The most important frugivores foraging on lychees were flying foxes (78.3%) and birds (16.1%), namely ring-necked parakeets (<i>Alexandrinus krameri</i>), red-whiskered bulbuls (<i>Pycnonotus jocosus</i>), village weavers (<i>Ploceus cucullatus</i>) and common mynas (<i>Acridotheres tristis</i>) while damage by alien mammals was negligible (<1%). Flying foxes consumed more fruits in the early night (59%) compared to the late night and this was statistically significant in one orchard and backyards. However, the difference in damage was on average one to three fruits per tree per night. Bird damage at both orchards was highest during the first half of the day (64%). Flying foxes ate fewer fruits towards the end of the fruiting season while birds followed the opposite trend. As fruit ripeness increased from unripe to fully ripe, flying foxes ate 39-42% more lychee pulp per fruit at the two orchards. Parakeets ate 7% more fruit pulp with increasing ripeness at one orchard only. Deliberate disturbances involving smoke, noise or light to deter flying foxes were common in orchards. The weak difference in the extent of flying fox damage to fruits between early and late night suggested at best minor advantages of concentrating deliberate disturbances in early night, and that netting would be a better strategy as it would also protect against diurnal frugivores. Additionally, trees should be protected from the sixth week after fruit set as most damage occurred when fruits were unripe. Such an improved timing of crop protection should play an important role in reducing fruit losses and thereby alleviate the human-wildlife conflict around the flying fox's diet.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "21"}}, {"article_title": "Knowledge and attitudes toward pediatric pain management among nursing interns from a selected university in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: a descriptive cross-sectional quantitative study.", "article_abstract": "Pediatric pain is often not addressed properly in the literature, which suggests a research gap in pediatric health-care providers' knowledge and attitudes toward the treatment of pain experienced by children in various health-care settings.

The antibacterial activity of MEO against four target bacteria was confirmed through inhibition zone assays, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) tests. The bacterial growth curve demonstrated that MEO significantly inhibited bacterial growth and effectively delayed the logarithmic growth phase. Mechanistic studies suggested that MEO primarily acts in the initial stages of bacterial growth by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane, leading to substantial leakage of intracellular materials, impairing metabolic activities, inducing lipid peroxidation, and enhancing oxidative stress, thereby inhibiting normal bacterial proliferation. Furthermore, MEO's antioxidant properties were evaluated through its scavenging effects on DPPH and hydroxyl radicals, as well as its ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). The findings revealed that MEO exhibited the strongest scavenging activity against DPPH radicals, followed by hydroxyl radical scavenging, with the FRAP results being comparatively weaker.

Yearling steers (n\u2005=\u2005134, 116, 131, in 2020, 2021, 2022, respectively) were assigned randomly to grazing pastures that had been managed at three levels of stocking rate (low, moderate, and high) since 1942, creating three distinct plant communities (high, moderate, and low diversity) that represent the treatments in this study. At the completion of the stocker phase, steers were maintained in their pasture groups for finishing and within year were harvested at a common compositional endpoint. Finishing phase performance and carcass data were collected. Production (kg/ha) and economic return per carcass and per ha were calculated. Vegetative diversity as a result of stocking rate treatment did not influence (<i>P</i>\u2005>\u20050.05) weight gain in the stocker phase, feedlot performance, carcass traits or carcass value. However, pastures with lower vegetative diversity as a result of high stocking rate returned greater overall beef production and economic value per ha due to the increase in animals produced per unit of land, thus demonstrating that stocking rate can influence the profitability of an operation without negatively impacting carcass traits.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "03", "day": "22"}}, {"article_title": "Differential associations of serum globulin and albumin-globulin ratio with depression in cancer and non-cancer populations: a cross-sectional study.", "article_abstract": "The association of globulin and albumin-globulin ratio (AGR) with depression in cancer and non-cancer populations remains understudied.

Knee osteoarthritis is a chronic joint disease characterised by degenerative cartilage lesions and secondary osteophytes in the knee joint. The symptoms of knee osteoarthritis tend to progress slowly, and at this stage, the number of patients with KOA is increasing. However, due to the adverse effects and poor therapeutic outcomes following surgical treatment, intervention therapy through the utilisation of biodegradable polymeric materials is required. Currently, clinical aspects are mainly used to treat cartilage degeneration in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee by using different kinds of biodegradable biopolymer materials with excellent physical properties, histocompatibility and other properties, combined with a drug delivery system, which can reduce the level of inflammation and stiffness in the focal area, and maximise the restoration of the patient's knee joint joint mobility and athletic ability.

Recent efforts have centered on understanding early events that trigger AD, aiming to facilitate early diagnosis and intervention for improved patient outcomes. The traditional histopathological features observed in AD encompass the extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta protein and the intracellular abnormal phosphorylation of Tau protein (pTau). However, elucidating how these pathological hallmarks ultimately contribute to cognitive deficits remains a complex challenge. While AD is commonly conceptualized as a disorder characterized by synaptic failure, substantial knowledge gaps persist regarding the mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of the disease, underscoring the need for novel and more effective therapeutic approaches. In this context, the impairment of GABAergic paravalbumin (PV+) neurons has been proposed as a crucial factor contributing to neuronal network dysfunction and cognitive decline in AD. The presence of pTau in pyramidal neurons is directly linked to their impairment in AD; however, the effect of pTau in PV+ neurons remains unclear. In this present study, we analyzed the existence of PV+ neurons containing pTau using immunocytochemistry in the hippocampal formation and entorhinal cortex of human samples from diagnosed AD cases and individuals without neurological or psychiatric disorders. Two pTau isoforms, pTau<sub>AT8</sub> and pTau<sub>pS396</sub>, corresponding to early and late stages of AD respectively, were examined. Our findings indicate that most PV+ neurons across the hippocampal formation and entorhinal cortex did not contain pTau in either group cases. Interestingly, while AD cases diagnosed with dementia exhibited a higher number of pTau+ neurons, the majority of PV+/pTau+ neurons were found in individuals with no neurological alterations. This suggests that the presence of pTau in PV+ neurons does not directly correlate with the overall abundance of pTau+ neurons. Given that PV+ neuron impairment is a key pathogenic mechanism in AD and is associated with cognitive decline, understanding the changes in PV+ neurons during AD progression could provide critical insights into the alterations of neuronal circuits underlying the disease.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "10"}}, {"article_title": "A physio-chemical mathematical model of the effects of blood analysis delay on acid-base, metabolite and electrolyte status: evaluation in blood from critical care patients.", "article_abstract": "Measurements of acid-base status are performed quickly after blood sampling avoiding errors.

Riboswitches are ubiquitous and well characterized in bacteria and prokaryotes, with additional examples also being found in fungi, plants, and yeast. To date, no purely RNA-small molecule riboswitch has been discovered in Homo Sapiens. Several analogous riboswitch-like mechanisms have been described within the H. Sapiens translatome within the past decade, prompting the question: Is there a H. Sapiens riboswitch dependent on only small molecule ligands? In this work, we set out to train positive unlabeled machine learning classifiers on known riboswitch sequences and apply the classifiers to H. Sapiens mRNA 5'UTR sequences found in the 5'UTR database, UTRdb, in the hope of identifying a set of mRNAs to investigate for riboswitch functionality. 67,683 riboswitch sequences were obtained from RNAcentral and sorted for ligand type and used as positive examples and 48,031 5'UTR sequences were used as unlabeled, unknown examples. Positive examples were sorted by ligand, and 20 positive-unlabeled classifiers were trained on sequence and secondary structure features while withholding one or two ligand classes. Cross validation was then performed on the withheld ligand sets to obtain a validation accuracy range of 75%-99%. The joint sets of 5'UTRs identified as potential riboswitches by the 20 classifiers were then analyzed. 1533 sequences were identified as a riboswitch by one or more classifier(s) and 436 of the H.

These 436 sequences were mapped back to the most similar riboswitches within the positive data and examined.

The rapid development of the rural digital economy has emerged as a new driving force for new-type urbanization. This study aims to explore how the rural digital economy impacts China's new-type urbanization from direct, heterogeneous, and indirect perspectives. Using the provincial-level panel data in China from 2014 to 2022, a mixed-methods approach is employed for the empirical research. The CRITIC and Entropy TOPSIS are used to assess the comprehensive development level and temporal characteristics of the rural digital economy and new-type urbanization. Moreover, a global-local auto-correlation analysis is carried out to depict the spatial distribution of the two variables. Subsequently, a two-way fixed effects model is constructed to verify the direct impact of the rural digital economy on new-type urbanization, as well as its structural and spatial heterogeneity characteristics. Finally, an mediating effect model is established to explore the impact paths through which the rural digital economy impacts new-type urbanization. The results show that the rural digital economy has significantly promoted new-type urbanization. Specifically, rural digital infrastructure, digital transformation of agriculture, agricultural production service informatization have a significant positive effect, while the role of rural life digitization is not significant. The rural digital economy has more significant positive impact on population agglomeration and economic growth, followed by social public service, but has no significant impact on ecological environmental protection and urban-rural coordination. Additionally, the qualitative analysis identifies geographical region, poverty, demographic structure and social equality as notable influencing factors in this impact. Further mechanism analysis result indicates that the rural digital economy impacts new-type urbanization through rural human capital improvement, agricultural economic growth and rural industrial structure upgrading. This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by providing the practical path of rural development to promote new-type urbanization in the context of the digital economy, also clarifies the weak points and key links in this process.

At the end of the process, the peroxide value was nearly five times greater than the limit set by the Codex Alimentarius (10 meq O2/kg). Biogenic amines, particularly cadaverine, were present but remained within acceptable limits. Metabarcoding analysis revealed that salt-tolerant bacteria dominated the fermentation process, while fungal activity was minimal.

Thus, focusing on the effects of smoking on muscle function, the objective was to investigate cut-off points based on functional limitation and identify the presence of kratopenia in smokers. This cross-sectional study, composed of smokers (conventional cigarettes), regardless of gender, aged over 18 years, was conducted with a comprehensive approach. The volunteers were evaluated by personal data, carbon monoxide analysis (monoximetry), and physical-functional aspects such as lung function (spirometry), functional performance (6-minute walk test, sit-to-stand, fourmeter gate speed, and physical activity in daily life), and peripheral muscle strength (portable digital dynamometry). A total of 143 smokers were evaluated, with high levels of tobacco dependence and preserved lung function. Men showed significantly higher peripheral muscle strength across all variables (p\u2009<\u20090.05). ROC analysis revealed acceptable discrimination for detecting kratopenia from functional limitation: AUC of 70% for knee extension (p\u2009<\u20090.01) from the cut-off points identified for knee extension lower than 214.8Nw and 273.6Nw; and 70% for knee flexion (p\u2009<\u20090.01) lower than 125 Nw and 156.2Nw, women and men, respectively, to be loss of muscle strength and power. Kratopenia was present in\u2009>\u200950% of participants based on peak torque (Nw) (56% of knee extension and 52% of knee flexion), being more prevalent in women. Peak knee torque measurements, especially those of extension and flexion, can determine kratopenia in limited functional smokers. Determining specific cut-off points offers an effective tool to identify and prevent sarcopenia risk in smokers.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "24"}}, {"article_title": "Recognizing employees' contribution to effectiveness and values: A randomized waitlist-controlled trial of operant-based leadership training.", "article_abstract": "To develop and sustain a healthy and efficient work environment, managers need to provide their employees with relevant and useful performance feedback. However, research on leadership training in functional behaviors, such as performance feedback, has yet to demonstrate consistent long-term effectiveness. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term influence of operant-based leadership training on managers' performance feedback behaviors. Municipality employees (n = 439) responded to a questionnaire four times over a period of 18 months. The employees' managers were randomized into an experimental and a control group. The managers in the experimental group received managerial behavioral training, while the waitlist control group managers did not. Multilevel growth curve modeling was used for data analysis. The results showed that employees in the experimental group reported a significantly greater improvement in their managers' performance feedback behaviors compared to employees in the control group (\u03b2 = 0.30, p = 0.04). Furthermore, the improvement in the experimental group managers' leadership behaviors had a linear trajectory throughout the 18-month study period, with no significant deceleration in their learning curve (\u0394\u03c72(2) = 2.2, p = 0.34). In conclusion, operant-based leadership training can help managers develop their performance feedback behaviors and the effect of such training is persistent over time. The findings imply that leadership training research and practice should strive to integrate operant learning theory and practice in order to improve the long-term effectiveness of leadership training interventions. Positive utility reactions, achieved by shaping leadership behaviors to optimize their fit with the managers' work context, may be critical for ensuring the enduring effects of leadership training.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "24"}}, {"article_title": "COVID-19 pandemic and risk factor measurement in individuals with cardio-renal-metabolic diseases: A retrospective study in the United Kingdom.", "article_abstract": "Comprehensive research about changes in risk factor (RF) management of people with chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic is sparse.

We curated labeled datasets of satellite images capturing approximately 1,000 historically active settlements in the Omo Valley of Ethiopia and the Samburu County of Kenya to train and evaluate deep learning models, studying their robustness to low spatial resolutions and limits in labeled training data. Using a novel training strategy that leveraged public road and water infrastructure data, we closed performance gaps introduced by shortages in labeled settlement data. We deployed our best model on a region spanning 5,400 square kilometers in the Omo Valley of Ethiopia, resulting in the identification of historical settlements with a 270-fold reduction in manual review volume.

Further, the expression of MX dynamin like GTPase 1 (mx1) in cancer is linked to immune evasion. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of CD80 and CD86 in histiocytic sarcoma (HS), a rare and progressive malignancy in dogs and to elucidate the status of the interferon-I pathway. Twenty-two tissue samples of HS from skin, lung and liver of 15 dogs were used. Immunohistochemistry targeting CD80, CD86, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), survivin, cleaved caspase-3 (Casp-3), stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and mx1 was performed. Slides were digitized and analyzed with QuPath. The numbers of CD86- and Casp-3 expressing cells showed a positive correlation. In the skin and lung, numbers of CD80 immunolabeled cells were higher than for CD86, while CD80 and CD86 levels were comparable in the liver. In general, low numbers of PD-L1 immunolabeled tumor cells were detected. Intranuclear survivin expression was linked to Casp-3. Mx1 and STING were expressed in tumor cells. A possible link between CD86 and Casp-3 points to a role of CD86 in tumor cell death.

In the data analysis, the association between redo surgery and explanatory variables was analyzed. Altogether, 1176 patients were identified for the analysis. Of these, 25 (2.1%) underwent redo surgery for 28 fracture sites. The most common reasons for redo surgery were inadequate fracture reductions of the zygomatic process or the mandible (19 patients) and inadequate orbital reconstructions (four patients). Compared with surgery of only the mandible, combined surgery of the mandible and midface had almost four times greater odds of redo surgery (95% CI 3.8, 0.8-18.4), but the finding was not statistically significant. Although redo surgery was required fairly infrequently, the findings highlight the relevance of surgical competence to treatment success; suboptimal surgical procedure was the most common reason for redo surgery.

Mgaloblishvili genome was sequenced using PacBio HiFi, resulting in a chromosome-scale diploid assembly of 986 Mbp, including 58\u2009912 predicted protein-coding genes across two phased chromosome sets. Comparative analysis with the susceptible PN40024 genome allowed us to identify differences in structure, gene content, and gene expression, as well as the impact of structural variants (SVs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between Mgaloblishvili and PN40024 loci. Resistance haplotypes were identified through DNA sequencing of a self-pollinated Mgaloblishvili population. Compared to orthologous regions in PN40024, the <i>Rpv29</i> locus in Mgaloblishvili exhibits reduced gene content, while the <i>Rpv31</i> locus has similar gene content.

This study aimed at molecular identification and genetic structure analysis of 200 isolates of <i>Z. tritici</i> representing six populations in central and south-eastern regions of Ethiopia. A total of 165 isolates were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear DNA (rDNA) region.

The microsatellite markers were highly polymorphic and informative, with mean number of alleles (Na), effective alleles (Ne), Nei's gene diversity of 6.23, 2.90, and 0.59, respectively. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) confirmed the presence of low population differentiation (F<sub>ST</sub> = 0.02), high gene flow (Nm = 14.7), with 95% of the total genetic variation residing within populations, and leaving only 5% for the among populations.

However, excessive exertion can lead to fatigue. Belt electrode-skeletal muscle electrical stimulation (B-SES) enhances muscle flexibility and prevents atrophy; however, its effectiveness in increasing muscle temperature as a passive warm-up strategy remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to examine the effects of B-SES on lower limb muscle temperature. Methods This cross-sectional study comprised 20 healthy adults randomly assigned to either a low-frequency (LF; 4 Hz) or high-frequency (HF; 20 Hz) B-SES condition. Electrical stimulation was applied to the dominant lower extremity for 10 min, and the muscle temperature was measured every minute during and after stimulation. Temperature changes over time and between groups were analyzed using repeated-measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Repeated-measures one-way ANOVAs were conducted as post hoc analyses. Results Muscle temperature significantly increased over time in LF and HF conditions (p < 0.01), starting from 2 min of stimulation (at 2 min, LF: 0.24 \u00b1 0.04\u2103; HF: 0.18 \u00b1 0.04\u2103). However, no significant differences were observed between the two stimulation conditions (p = 0.09). The median fatigue rating on the visual analog scale was 31.5 mm (interquartile range, 14.8-60.8 mm). Conclusion B-SES effectively increased the muscle temperature within a short duration, suggesting its potential as an efficient passive warm-up method. Further research is required to explore its functional benefits in athletic performance and rehabilitation settings.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "03", "day": "24"}}, {"article_title": "Managing Hepatic Cysts in the Setting of Surgery for Cholecystitis.", "article_abstract": "Hepatic cysts are relatively common and often present with non-specific symptoms such as nausea and abdominal pain.

This report presents a case in which posterior fixation alone successfully achieved pain relief and improved stability in a patient with HCC metastasis involving extensive osteolysis of a C1 lateral mass and encasement of the vertebral artery. A 71-year-old male presented with a worsening right cervical pain. The patient had been prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid analgesics, yet the pain remained unresolved. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 5.5 cm osteolytic tumor at the C1 lateral mass with circumferential involvement of the vertebral artery. The patient was diagnosed with spinal metastasis from HCC, characterized by spinal instability (Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS), 11) and intractable pain (visual analog scale (VAS), 7.7). The patient was bedridden because of an inability to support head loads (performance status (PS), 4), and it was considered difficult to initiate ongoing chemotherapy. The patient was referred for surgical intervention to relieve the pain and improve stability. To address the pain and instability, occipitocervical (C2-C5) posterior fixation was performed without tumor resection. Due to extensive tumor invasion, pedicle screw placement at C2 was not feasible, and C2 translaminar screw fixation was selected instead. Postoperatively, the patient experienced significant pain relief and regained ambulatory ability. At one month postoperatively, fixation remained stable, with VAS improving to 0.8 and PS to 1. The patient was able to maintain pain relief and exhibited improved stability, allowing him to walk, and durvalumab/tremelimumab chemotherapy was initiated two months after surgery. The primary goals of managing metastatic tumors at the CVJ are pain relief, neurological function preservation, and spinal stability. In this case, posterior fixation alone achieved substantial pain alleviation and stability improvement without tumor resection. Notably, the use of C2 translaminar screws minimized the risks of spinal cord and vertebral artery injuries while ensuring effective stabilization. This is the first report to demonstrate the efficacy of posterior fixation alone for HCC metastases with complete destruction of the articular facet at C1. Posterior fixation alone can provide effective pain relief and restore stability in metastatic tumors with severe osteolysis of the C1 lateral mass. Careful selection of fixation techniques can minimize intraoperative complications while improving the patient's quality of life.

We have undertaken an in-depth characterization of reno-renal reflex function in CKD using an anesthetized rodent model with concurrent physiological outflows assessed. Using anesthetized male Lewis Polycystic Kidney (LPK) rats and normotensive Lewis controls, we investigated the cardiovascular [blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and sympathetic responses (recorded from renal and splanchnic nerves (r/sSNA)] to renal capsaicin (50 \u00b5M) and direct electrical stimulation of the whole renal nerve. In Lewis rats, intra-pelvic renal capsaicin injection resulted in a depressor, bradycardic, and sympathoinhibitory response in sSNA with no significant change in rSNA. In contrast, the same stimulus led to a pressor and sympathoexcitatory response in the LPK group. In Lewis rats, low-intensity electrical stimulation (0.2 ms pulses, 15 \u03bcA, 2-40 Hz) of the renal nerve elicited a depressor response and bradycardia with concurrent sympathoexcitation (sSNA), whereas high-intensity (150 \u00b5A) stimulation induced a biphasic depressor/pressor response and tachycardia. In LPK rats, low-intensity renal nerve electrical stimulation triggered a biphasic depressor/pressor BP response, tachycardia, and sympathoexcitation. High-intensity stimulation similarly caused a biphasic depressor/pressor BP response and tachycardia. The magnitude of the sSNA response and both phases of the blood pressure response was higher in LPK compared to Lewis. All responses showed some degree of frequency dependency.

Participants wore Fitbit trackers, generating time-series data on activity. The PEER group completed an 8-week program, while the control group received CDC fall prevention pamphlets. PA data were analyzed using smoothing spline analysis of variance (SSANOVA), chosen for its flexibility in modeling complex, non-linear relationships in time-series data and its ability to handle skewed distributions and repeated measures. Unlike traditional parametric models, SSANOVA decomposes temporal trends into interpretable components, capturing both smooth trends and abrupt changes, such as those occurring on group workout days. This capability ensures robust and nuanced analysis of intervention effects. Results showed PEER participants significantly increased evenly and had very active minutes and reduced sedentary behavior during the intervention. No significant effect was found for light active minutes. Specifically, during the intervention period, PEER participants engaged in an average of 6.7% fewer sedentary minutes per day, 13.8% additional fairly active minutes per day, and 2.8% additional very active minutes per day compared to the control group. While the reduction in sedentary minutes and increase in fairly active minutes were not statistically significant, the increase in very active minutes was significant. However, our functional time-series analysis revealed these improvements diminished over the 15-week follow-up, indicating challenges in maintaining PA.

With continuous use, sensory adaptation, habituation and adaptive behavioural changes often reduce the efficacy of sensory deterrents. Theory suggests responses can be maintained with application practices that modulate the stimulus in time (on/off) or by continuously varying stimulus intensity. In aquatic environments, damage-released alarm cues from injured conspecifics are a reliable source of information regarding predation risk that can be used to guide the movements of invasive fishes. We used sea lampreys, <i>Petromyzon marinus</i>, drawn from an invasive population, to investigate whether modulating alarm cue exposure (on/off) or varying cue concentration during continuous exposure (low/high) would forestall predicted declinations in swim activity and spatial avoidance. We found that continuous exposure to alarm cue at a fixed concentration resulted in the predicted decline in swim activity. Modulating odour exposure timing (on/off) partially prevented response declination in swim activity, whereas varying odour concentration (low/high) fully prevented the reduction. We did not observe the previously reported habituation of the spatial avoidance response, likely due to the use of a small high-throughput assay system. Our results suggest modulating alarm cue exposure by varying odour concentration to prevent response declination holds promise as a management practice.

The root microbiome, consisting of diverse microbes, plays a crucial role in enhancing plant resilience to abiotic stressors. However, the effects of foot traffic on these microbes and the mechanisms they employ to help plant survival remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated how foot traffic affected microbial communities of the root endosphere, rhizosphere, and bulk soil in Bermudagrass (<i>Cynodon</i> spp.) and Zoysiagrass (<i>Zoysia</i> spp.) turfs. Foot traffic was simulated to mimic six professional football games per week using a modified Baldree traffic simulator. High-throughput amplicon sequencing targeting 16S rRNA for bacteria and ITS for fungi was employed to analyze microbial communities. Foot traffic slightly and significantly reduced soil moisture and inorganic nitrogen, likely due to soil compaction and associated impairment on microbial activity. Microbial alpha diversity varied across microhabitats, with no discernible effect of foot traffic. However, microbial community composition was impacted by foot traffic, being more pronounced on bacteria of the root endosphere and on fungi of the bulk soil. In light of the genetic potential predicted by PICRUSt2, foot traffic enriched a few pathways of the endophytic bacteriome, including nitrifier denitrification (PWY7084) and mannosylglycerate biosynthesis (PWY5656). This indicated that root endophytes could help turfgrass to tolerate foot traffic via controls on the concentration of nitric oxide, the signaling molecule for root growth, and mannosylglycerate, the compatible solute for protecting enzymes against osmotic stress. Foot traffic also enhanced degradation pathways of carbohydrates and 4-coumarate, the constituent of turfgrass cell walls (PWY-3801, PWY-2221, PWY-7046), indicating the faster turnover of root tissues. Along the root-rhizosphere-bulk soil continuum, the bacteriome varied substantially in composition and also exhibited contrasting genetic potentials from stress alleviation to nutrient supply in coping with grass growth. But foot traffic had little effect on the genetic potential of bacteriome in rhizosphere and bulk soil. Our findings indicated that the endophytic bacteriome was more sensitive to foot traffic than the bacteriome in the rhizosphere and bulk soil and could potentially help turf survival via influences on plant signal molecules and compatible solutes.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "09"}}, {"article_title": "Herpes simplex virus 1 glycoprotein C promotes virus penetration from endosomes during entry, independent of interaction with heparan sulfate.", "article_abstract": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) gC is a multi-functional glycoprotein present in the viral envelope and on the surface of infected cells. Virion gC, and to a lesser extent the fusion protein gB, interacts with host heparan sulfate to mediate HSV-1 attachment to the cell surface. Virion gC selectively facilitates HSV-1 entry into cells that support entry by a low pH-dependent endocytic pathway. gC regulates fusion-associated conformational changes in gB. Here we investigated the mechanism by which gC plays a post-attachment role in HSV-1 entry into cells. HSV-1 entered HS-deficient cells by a low pH-dependent route. Similarly, HSV-1 deleted for HS-binding domains entered HS-bearing cells by a low pH pathway. Thus, the presence of HS on cells and the ability of HSV-1 to engage HS do not direct HSV-1 to a pH-dependent entry pathway. HSV-1 lacking gC accumulated in endosomes during viral entry, supporting the notion that gC influences viral penetration from endosomes. Interestingly, the pH-neutral cell-cell fusion mediated by HSV-1 glycoproteins gB, gD, and gH/gL was not altered by gC. Soluble heparin inhibited cell-cell fusion regardless of the presence of gC or heparan sulfate. The kinetics of endocytic uptake of gC-null HSV-1 was rapid and very similar to wild type virus. Thus, the role of gC in regulating low pH entry of HSV-1 occurs downstream of internalization of enveloped particles from the plasma membrane. Together, the results presented here and elsewhere support a post-attachment, post-internalization function for gC in HSV-1 entry that is independent of HS.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "09"}}, {"article_title": "Dual role of microorganisms in metal corrosion: a review of mechanisms of corrosion promotion and inhibition.", "article_abstract": "The dual role of microorganisms in metal corrosion and corrosion inhibition reflects their complex biochemical interactions. In terms of corrosion, certain microorganisms accelerate metal oxidation by producing acidic metabolites or facilitating electrochemical processes, thereby causing damage to the material. Conversely, under specific conditions, they can form biofilms and/or biominerals that create protective layers, reducing the oxidation rate and delaying corrosion. This paper provides a comprehensive illustration of microbial corrosion promotion and inhibition, emphasizing the importance of key microorganisms involved in these corrosive processes. Microorganisms, including sulfate-reducing bacteria, nitrate-reducing bacteria, iron-oxidizing and iron-reducing bacteria and certain fungi, contribute to corrosion through their metabolic activities. Microbial corrosion mechanisms can be classified into extracellular electron transfer, microbial metabolism corrosion and the oxygen concentration cell theory. In contrast, microorganisms can effectively mitigate metal corrosion through a range of mechanisms including reduction of dissolved oxygen levels, secretion of antimicrobial substances, biological competition and biomineralization. Microbial corrosion and inhibition generally arise from multiple mechanisms working together, rather than a single cause. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms can provide a theoretical basis and practical guidance for the development of new anti-corrosion strategies.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "09"}}, {"article_title": "Resolution of MALDI-TOF compared to whole genome sequencing for identification of <i>Bacillus</i> species isolated from cleanrooms at NASA Johnson Space Center.", "article_abstract": "Bacteria are frequently isolated from surfaces in cleanrooms, where astromaterials are curated, at NASA's Lyndon B.

To explore the lived experiences of CaLD international students in overcoming the challenges during the pandemic. <b>Method:</b> A descriptive qualitative research design guided by constructivist grounded theory was used in this study. Students were recruited via flyers posted on the institutional digital learning platform. Nineteen in-depth 1 to 1 online interviews were conducted using an interview guide. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed using constant comparison analysis. <b>Results:</b> Three themes emerged from the collected data that described the participants' lived experiences, and they were (1) viewing international education as the pursuit of a better life, (2) focusing on personal growth, and (3) coming out of the ashes we rise. <b>Discussion:</b> The findings highlight the importance of recognizing the investments and sacrifices that CaLD international students and their families make in pursuit of international tertiary education.

This study aimed to further explore the anti-HBV effects of AKG2, particularly its effects on the epigenetic landscape of cccDNA. HBV-transfected and -infected cells were used to assess the impact of AGK2 on viral replication. Changes in SIRT2 expression and \u03b1-tubulin acetylation (SDS-PAGE-immunoblotting), core particle formation (native agarose gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting), HBV RNA (northern blotting) and DNA (Southern blotting) synthesis, and cccDNA levels (Southern blotting) were measured. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to examine deposition of transcriptionally repressive epigenetic markers on cccDNA. AGK2 reduced expression of SIRT2, increased acetylated \u03b1-tubulin levels, and reduced synthesis of HBV RNA and DNA. Importantly, AGK2 also reduced cccDNA levels and increased deposition of repressive histone markers H4K20me1, H3K27me3, and H3K9me3 on cccDNA, mediated by histone lysine methyltransferases such as PR-Set7, EZH2, SETDB1, and SUV39H1. Additionally, there was a reduction in recruitment of RNA polymerase II and acetylated H3 to cccDNA, indicating that AGK2 enhances transcriptional repression.

Parents of these students (<i>n</i> = 1629) completed the questionnaire, which comprised information on demographics, dietary habits, food allergies, and allergy history. <b>Results:</b> The parent-reported food allergies exhibited a prevalence of 11.5% (95% confidence interval\u2009=\u200910-13%). Of these reported allergies, 10.1% (95% CI\u2009=\u20098.6-11.7%) were classified as convincing, while only 5.7% (95% CI\u2009=\u20094.5-6.8%) received a formal diagnosis from a healthcare professional. The most commonly reported allergens included eggs (17.8%), cow's milk (15.8%), peanuts (14.5%), and strawberries (13.8%). The majority of children (67.1%) had a single reported allergen, while 15.8% had two, and 17.2% had more than two allergens identified. Food allergies were significantly more prevalent among children with comorbid atopic conditions and those with a family history of allergies. Additionally, regional variations were observed, with high prevalence rates in metropolitan regions. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study emphasizes the significance of considering persuasive food allergy (FA) data in addition to parent-reported information. The findings highlight the considerable burden of food allergies and their relationship with other atopic disorders.

Temporally, core mixoplankton exhibited a higher relative proportion in spring and winter in contrast to core heterotrophs and a more uniform spatial distribution pattern. While seasonal patterns were observed in the environmental responses of the trophic groups, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>-N) were identified as the key drivers affecting the core mixoplankton by random forest.

Environmental pollutants could activate astrocytes into A1 (toxic) or A2 (protective) types and induce different effects. Meanwhile, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is an environmental molecule sensor in the body and has various ligands. But the difference between exogenous and endogenous AhR ligands on the astrocytic activation is unclear; in this study, we employed rat primary cultured cortical astrocytes to reveal the effects and mechanisms of AhR ligands on astrocytic activation. We found that, after treatment with exogenous AhR ligand (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, TCDD) ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 nmol/L, astrocytes mainly exhibited A2 type activation. The specific manifestation includes the increase in the expression of A2 marker genes, the enhancement of cellular autonomous movement, the expression and secretion of chemokines, such as Cxcl10, Cxcl2, and Ccl7. And TCDD-induced A2 type astrocytes show a positive impact on neuronal synaptic formation. Although both TCDD and endogenous AhR ligand (6-formylindolo[3,2-<i>b</i>] carbazole, FICZ) could activate AhR pathway in astrocytes, FICZ (50 nmol/L) neither induces activation of A2 type astrocytes nor upregulation of chemokines.

Among them, 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium (M8OI) has been detected at high concentrations in soils and exhibits hepatotoxic properties. To uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying this toxicity, whole-transcriptome sequencing was performed, coupled with benchmark dose (BMD) modeling, to derive transcriptomic points-of-departure (tPOD) through dose-response analysis. The transcriptomic analysis identified 425, 667, and 567 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) following low (10 \u03bcmol/L), medium (50 \u03bcmol/L), and high (200 \u03bcmol/L) doses of M8OI exposure, respectively. Enrichment analysis revealed significant perturbations in pathways related to cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and IL-17 signaling. BMD modeling yielded tPOD values of 1.51 \u03bcmol/L (median of the 20 most sensitive genes, omicBMD<sub>20</sub>), 2.98 \u03bcmol/L (tenth percentile of all genes, omicBMD<sub>10th</sub>), 6.83 \u03bcmol/L (mode of the first peak of all gene BMDs, omicBMD<sub>mode</sub>), and 5.9 \u03bcmol/L for pathway-level analysis. These transcriptomics-derived tPODs were at least 105-fold lower than M8OI's hepatotoxic concentration, as indicated by its EC<sub>50</sub> of 723.6 \u03bcmol/L in HepG2 cells. Functional analysis of the transcriptomic data identified legionellosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and transcriptional misregulation in cancer as the most sensitive pathways affected by M8OI. These findings highlight the molecular mechanisms driving M8OI-induced hepatotoxicity and underscore the utility of transcriptomics in deriving sensitive and quantitative toxicity thresholds.

We posited that high repeatability in counts among temporally replicated surveys would indicate that counts are a good index of abundance. We temporally replicated 49 nocturnal spotlight surveys of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) up to three times each (n = 128 total samples) to test the repeatability of this commonly used wildlife monitoring technique. Repeatability was high (R = 0.86), suggesting spring spotlight surveys provide a reliable index of deer population size in Iowa, USA. Fourteen percent of the variation among replicated counts was explained by day of year and, to a lesser degree, a vegetation green-up index. Detection probability was high (~0.70) early in the sampling season and declined considerably during the following 6 weeks. Deer abundance was greater at sites with higher percent landcovers of forest and hay/pasture and was lower at sites with higher landcover in crops. Our findings suggest deer managers should sample prior to green-up in the spring to maximize the proportion of the population that is detectable, and that accounting for seasonality on detection estimation is important for reliable abundance estimates if sampling occurs over a range of phenological progression. Finally, we show that temporal replication of surveys is a logistically feasible method to assess the reliability of abundance estimates from study designs that are normally conducted with single visits.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "23"}}, {"article_title": "From algorithms to negotiations: Why health diplomacy must adapt.", "article_abstract": "Health diplomacy traditionally relies on consensus-building across nations, yet the accelerating integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into health systems poses new governance challenges. Rapidly changing geopolitical conditions-exemplified by shifts in U.S. global health funding and the expansion of AI beyond national boundaries-underscore the urgency of rethinking traditional approaches. This paper, based on insights from the Prince Mahidol Award Conference 2025 side meeting on \"Navigating the Future: AI & Global Health Diplomacy,\" examines how AI can reshape the practice of health diplomacy, both empowering and unsettling global health objectives. We first explore the promise of AI in enhancing disease surveillance, resource allocation, and progress toward universal health coverage. However, inadequate governance can exacerbate inequalities, particularly if AI remains in the hands of profit-focused enterprises or if digital divides persist. Health diplomacy, therefore, must expand its purview to include technical literacy, data ethics, and robust regulatory frameworks that safeguard equity and transparency in AI design and deployment. To illustrate these dynamics, we emphasise the interplay of social, political, commercial, and digital determinants of health, each feeding into AI-driven innovations. Strong diplomatic engagement is critical to ensuring that AI becomes a tool for mutual benefit rather than a catalyst for further fragmentation. Effective policies must integrate environmental sustainability considerations alongside cross-sector collaboration. We conclude that, although AI cannot replace the vital human element of negotiation and trust-building, it can substantially enhance global health outcomes when governed ethically and inclusively.

Future space tourists will have to face the harshness of the environment, especially the travel, and adapt quickly for their own safety. This issue raises both the question of preparation and the impact of such a journey on novice populations who have not been selected for their physical and cognitive abilities. The objectives of the study are (1) to investigate the impact of space travel on psychophysiological and sensory responses during a parabolic flight experience; (2) to assess recovery from this experience one week later; and (3) to evaluate the relevance of high parasympathetic functioning at baseline as a biomarker of adaptation. Seventeen healthy participants were enrolled in the 79th ESA Parabolic Flight Campaign on board the Airbus A310. Psychological, physiological, and sensory responses were measured at different times from the day before the 3h-flight (baseline) to one week after the flight (recovery). Labels were allocated to two groups according to their parasympathetic functioning at baseline: high parasympathetic (HP) profile and low parasympathetic (LP) profile. At the psychological level, those with an HP profile have a higher coping acceptation and a higher level of interoceptive awareness than the LP profile, except for sleep quality. At the physiological and exteroceptive level, they have a higher heart rate variability, preserved identification of odors and a predisposition to a more adaptive postural response postflight. Nevertheless, postural stability is affected in both profiles, particularly during visual deprivation, while their heart rate variability is increased in both linear and non-linear components. Nevertheless, our results reveal that the recovery constitutes a critical period. Flyers have a decrease of interoceptive awareness and emotions, especially the HP profile. Although the LP profile reported a better subjective sleep quality, both profiles decreased their sleep quality. These results raise the question of the risks that may be induced by space tourism. They highlight two major outcomes: (1) travel of future space tourists does not seem to be at risk as long as the individuals are qualified and fit for the flight and adaptation may be improved by targeting parasympathetic functioning; (2) level of experience has no impact on the psychophysiological and sensory responses. The results highlight the need to monitor the crews over several days and/or to include in the preparation a module allowing them to be prepared for the postflight period and the return to life on Earth.

The aim of the present study was to identify genetic markers for tail length and to define candidate genes.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in regulating various processes in asthma.

Our study found that inhibition of miR-770-5p alleviated airway inflammation and remodeling in asthmatic mice. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis revealed that circ-0001454 harbors binding sites for miR-770-5p, acting as a sponge to adsorb miR-770-5p and function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), thereby negatively regulating the expression of miR-770-5p. Circ-0001454 not only alleviated airway inflammation and remodeling in asthmatic mice, but also participated in modulating the HDM-induced inflammatory response in BEAS-2B cells. It mitigated bronchial epithelial cell inflammatory damage, reduced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and mitochondrial membrane potential loss.

The container system was tested at 4 depopulation events where the pigs' behavior was filmed (1 event) and the duration of the various procedures was recorded. The results showed that the system's capacity met AVMA's recommendations for a CO<sub>2</sub> supply rate of 10% to 30% of the chamber volume per min.

Fused data that integrate environmental and phenotypic information from smart livestock farms with genetic data are valuable for detailed applications in breeding and specifications, as they help understand complex and organic phenotypes and environments. However, their effectiveness is limited by restrictions on data sharing and non-standardized formats. This limitation leads to other restrictions against researchers, such as restrictions on the range of projects, the supply of new technologies or farm species, and policy development or application restrictions. Therefore, promoting a recirculating environment to increase productivity, developing climate-adapted livestock, and implementing policies are necessary.

Identification of the genes influencing the fatty acid composition of meat is very important for the selection and breeding of chickens with desirable and healthier fatty acid profiles. The objective of this study was to identify functional candidate genes for fatty acid profiles of the breast meat of the Korean native chicken-red-brown line (KNC-R) through genome-wide association studies. We genotyped 382 KNC-R chickens (190 males, 192 females) using the Illumina chicken 60K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), and association tests were performed by mixed linear model in the Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) software, based on mixed linear model analysis-leave-one-chromosome-out (MLMA-LOCO). We detected one SNP each on chromosomes 2 (rs13667281), 10 (rs14011157), and 22 (rs10731996) that were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with nervonic (C24:1), linoleic (C18:2), and eicosadienoic (C20:2) acids, respectively.

In addition to direct hepatic complications, extra-hepatic complications, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic kidney disease and some malignancies, are increasingly recognized. CVD, including atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF), is the leading cause of death in patients with MASLD. External factors, including excess energy intake, sedentary lifestyle and xenobiotic use, induce inflammation-related complications. MASLD, AF, and HF are associated with immune system activation, including the reprogramming of immune cells and the establishment of immune memory. Emerging evidence suggests that the heart and the liver cross-talk with each other through the diverse spectrum of autocrine, paracrine and endocrine mechanisms. Pro-inflammatory cytokines produced from the liver and the heart circulate systemically to orchestrate metabolic derangements that promote the systematic immune dysregulation in the heart-liver axis and the development of end-organ complications. Cardio-hepatic syndrome describes the clinical and biochemical evidence of hepatic dysfunction and cardiac pathology due to the interaction between the heart and the liver. Activation of inflammatory cascades, oxidative stress and immune system dysregulation underlie key mechanisms in bringing about such pathological changes. This review focuses on the current clinical and molecular evidence about the heart-liver cross-talk. It summarizes the epidemiological and pathophysiological associations of MASLD, AF and HF.

We investigate the velocity-force trade-off and its implications for adaptation of the anatomically complex fish jaw system among 89 species of percid fishes (Percidae). We test alternative hypotheses about how the trade-off may symmetrically or asymmetrically constrain jaw diversity. We find that the trade-off has a strong impact on the structural diversity of the jaws, indicating that specialization acts as a constraint on the phenotype. Force-modified jaws are compact with short snouts and a small oral cavity, while velocity-modified jaws are more robust with elongate snouts and a large oral cavity. The distribution of craniofacial diversity along the extremes is asymmetrical, as species with velocity-modified jaws are more phenotypically dissimilar than those with force-modified jaws. The rate of phenotypic evolution is also asymmetrical, as lineages with velocity- and force-modified jaws evolve slower and faster than unspecialized jaws, respectively. This discrepancy between phenotypic diversity and rate of evolution is explained by time to evolve, as force-modified jaws arose comparatively nearer the present. We expand recent literature linking trade-offs to asymmetrical macroevolutionary patterns, which may be an underappreciated cause of the uneven distribution of vertebrate diversity.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "07"}}, {"article_title": "In vitro human gastrointestinal digestibility and colonic fermentation of edible yeast-based protein: A comparative study with whey and casein.", "article_abstract": "The global protein demand is in constant increase requiring sustainable and healthier alternative proteins for animal and human nutrition.

Cases that seek care through pharmacies and community health workers (CHW) are frequently excluded from disease burden estimates, which are used to allocate mitigation resources. Studies on care-seeking behavior can help identify these gaps but typically focus on children under five, even though diarrheal diseases like cholera and Enterotoxigenic E. coli affect all age groups. This study aimed to estimate the proportion of individuals seeking care for themselves or their children with diarrhea, considering different age groups, case definitions, and study settings. We conducted a systematic review of population-based primary research studies published during 2000-2024 that examined care-seeking behavior for diarrhea. We included 166 studies from 62 countries. Hospitals and clinics were the most common source of care sought outside the home, with CHW and health posts rarely reported. Using a random-effects meta-analysis, we found substantial heterogeneity in care-seeking between studies from low- and middle-income countries (I2 = 99.3) and estimated that the proportion of diarrhea cases seeking care at a hospital or clinic was 32.8% on average (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 28.1% to 37.9%; prediction interval 3.3% to 87.5%). Although there were trends toward higher care-seeking for children compared to adults, substantial variation existed between studies, and the differences were not significant. We estimated that the adjusted odds of seeking care at a hospital or clinic were significantly higher for severe diarrhea and cholera compared to general diarrhea (Odds Ratio 3.43; 95% CI 1.71 to 6.88). Our findings confirm that passive surveillance through hospitals and clinics may substantially undercount the number of people with diarrhea, particularly those with milder symptoms, although this proportion varied widely. Additionally, our findings underscore the importance of including care-seeking questions across all age groups in future studies, as we cannot assume lower care-seeking for adults across all settings.

To balance the efficiency and performance, we propose a Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff Network (SATNet) for Lightweight RGB-D SOD from three fundamental perspectives: depth quality, modality fusion, and feature representation. Concerning depth quality, we introduce the Depth Anything Model to generate high-quality depth maps,which effectively alleviates the multi-modal gaps in the current datasets. For modality fusion, we propose a Decoupled Attention Module (DAM) to explore the consistency within and between modalities.

For feature representation, we develop a Dual Information Representation Module (DIRM) with a bi-directional inverted framework to enlarge the limited feature space generated by the lightweight backbones. DIRM models texture features and saliency features to enrich feature space, and employ two-way prediction heads to optimal its parameters through a bi-directional backpropagation.

It is considered an aggressive subtype with limited treatment options, based mainly on chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy. Materials and methods This retrospective study examines the epidemiological, clinical, pathological, and therapeutic characteristics of TNBC. It is based on a series of 23 cases collected from the Medical Oncology Department of the Cheikh Khalifa Ibn Zaid Al Nahyan International University Hospital in Casablanca, Morocco, over a period of three years and six months. The study focuses on newly diagnosed patients with TNBC, with data collected from the medical records of patients who were diagnosed and treated during this period. Follow-up data were analyzed to assess disease progression and treatment response, but all cases included were diagnosed during the study period. Results Of the total 242 breast cancer cases, 12.4% (30 cases) were diagnosed with TNBC. Due to missing data, only 23 cases were included in the final analysis. The average age of patients was 51.35 years, and 26.09% (six patients) had a family history of breast cancer. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) was the most common histological type, accounting for 91.30% (21 cases) of cases, with a mean tumor size of 40.69 mm. Histoprognostic grades II and III were predominant, representing 30.43% (seven cases) and 52.17% (12 cases) of cases, respectively. Surgical treatments included conservative lumpectomy in 43.48% (10 patients), radical mastectomy according to the Patey technique in 26.09% (six patients), and no surgery for 30.43% (seven patients). Chemotherapy was administered to 69.6% (16 patients) of patients, with 39.1% (nine patients) receiving adjuvant therapy and 30.4% (seven patients) undergoing neoadjuvant treatment. Lymph node involvement was present in 63.64% (14 patients) of cases, with bone metastasis in 45.45% (10 patients) and lung metastasis in 27.27% (six patients). The disease course was considered unfavorable in 55% (13 patients) of cases, with disease progression observed in these patients.

Exceeding the upgaze limit without head movement increases reflex contraction of the OFM to raise the eyebrows and pull the scalp backward while also causing involuntary contraction of the upper trapezius muscle (UTM) to extend the head backward, resulting in tension-type headaches (TTH) and neck pain. Due to aponeurosis disinsertion from the tarsus, we hypothesized that increased mechanoreceptor stretching in the STM reflexively contracts both the OFM and UTM. We report a case series of five patients whose aponeurosis disinsertion caused tonic eyebrow-raising, TTH, and neck pain. In the first case, asymmetrical disinsertion with dominance on the left side led to a more pronounced contraction of the OFM and UTM, resulting in TTH and neck pain on that side. After surgery to reduce mechanoreceptor stretching, symptoms resolved. The second and third cases, which involved symmetrical disinsertion, showed that unilateral eyebrow lifting using tape to alleviate mechanoreceptor stretching reduced ipsilateral UTM contraction in length and hardness. The fourth case, also with symmetrical disinsertion, experienced symptom relief post-surgery. In the fifth case, the eyebrows were maximally raised due to severe aponeurosis disinsertion, and the head was extended backward and protruded. Bilateral aponeurosis reinsertion lowered the eyebrows and reduced the extension/protrusion of the head, relieving TTH and neck pain. These cases suggest that increased mechanoreceptor stretching in the STM reflexively contracts the slow-twitch fibers of the OFM and UTM, contributing to TTH and neck pain as part of coordinated eye, eyebrow, and head movements.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "03", "day": "17"}}, {"article_title": "Comparative Evaluation of the Sealing Ability of Root Canal Sealers: An In Vitro Study Using Dye Penetration and Scanning Electron Microscopic Analysis.", "article_abstract": "Achieving an impervious seal in root canal treatment is crucial for preventing bacterial infiltration and ensuring long-term success.

Due to the increased risk of bleeding, these patients generally cannot tolerate antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies. This poses a particular hurdle when treating acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Our case involves a 79-year-old male patient with a past medical history of HHT, major gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and coronary artery disease who presented with a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and acute-on-chronic anemia. Our treatment options were limited given his intolerance to antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies which resulted in major GIB, making him a poor candidate for percutaneous coronary intervention. We consulted cardiology and treated him with beta-blockers to decrease oxygen demand, packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion to increase oxygen supply, and ranolazine for symptom relief. His symptoms improved and he was discharged. Four weeks later, he suffered a cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. His family chose to pursue comfort measures, and he was transferred to an inpatient hospice. By reporting this case, we aim to highlight the unique challenges faced when managing ACS in patients with HHT.

A study was conducted to evaluate the symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD) and anxiety in women who tested positive and negative for COVID-19 and delivered in a tertiary-level hospital in Eastern India during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2021. The objective was to explore the clinical and socio-demographic risk factors associated with PPD. Methodology A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted\u00a0among women who were either positive or negative for COVID-19 in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Patna. A semi-structured questionnaire (the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) questionnaire validated in Hindi) was used to collect socio-demographic and clinical details. The questionnaire included sections on socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to COVID-19. For the study, the EPDS score\u00a0was\u00a0calculated to assess feelings of the last seven days. A score\u00a0below 8 was indicative of depression not likely, while scores of 9-11 indicated a possibility of depression, and scores of 12-13 suggested a high likelihood of depression. The cut-off score of 12 or higher was used to compare group differences in depression. The anxiety dimension was measured as the cumulative score from items 3, 4, and 5 in the EPDS (EPDS-3A). The sample size was determined to be 51 in each group, assuming a threefold increase in PPD among COVID-19-positive women who delivered at AIIMS Patna, with a study power of 80% and a significance level of 5%. Results A total of 327 candidates were invited to participate, of which 290 completed questionnaires were analyzed, comprising 237 COVID-19-negative and 53 COVID-19-positive mothers. The mean ages, age group distribution, family structure, and residence type were similar in both COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative mothers. The prevalence of depression among COVID-19-negative mothers was 13.5% (32/237) with a mean EPDS score of 5.4 \u00b1 3.8 as compared to 39.6% (21/53) with a mean EPDS score of 11.7 \u00b1 3.3 among COVID-19-positive mothers. A statistically significant association of PPD was noted with financial crisis (59.4%) in COVID-19-negative mothers. Poor family support was associated with both COVID-19-negative (81.2%) and COVID-19-positive (66.7%) mothers. Poor availability of medical services (66.7%), societal discrimination (76.2%), and loss of/minimal leisure activities (81%) were significantly associated with COVID-19-positive mothers. Financial crisis (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 4.3; 95% CI: 1.76-10.38; p = 0.001) and poor family support (AOR: 4.1; 95% CI: 1.33-12.29; p = 0.01) emerged as independent predictors of depression among COVID-19-negative mothers. Among COVID-19 positives, illiteracy (AOR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.5-9.2; p = 0.01) and social discrimination (AOR: 16.5; 95% CI: 1.9-144.2; p = 0.01) were the independent predictors for PPD. Conclusions The prevalence of PPD and anxiety was found to be three times higher in COVID-19-positive mothers. Significant contributing factors included poor family support, lack of access to antenatal services, societal discrimination, and limited leisure activities during the pandemic.

This data highlights the fact that i) the RGD motif is not exposed in the entire spike protein and ii) the need of a cofactor favoring spike/\u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> interaction. HSPGs are used by different viruses as receptors and coreceptors for their entry into host cells.

Additional features, such as craniofacial anomalies, tongue malformations, and limb defects, may also be present. The etiology of this syndrome is not well established but the ischemic necrosis of the brainstem leading to hypoplasia of the cranial nerve nuclei is the supposed to be most likely one. MBS leads to a large angle esotropia along with bilateral limitation of abduction with delayed diagnosis, which is very challenging to correct with a single procedure. There are only a few reports illustrating the surgical outcome of strabismus in MBS. In this case report, we describe an unusual case of unilateral MBS who presented with large esotropia since childhood and was managed by two-stage strabismus surgery, including unilateral medial rectus (MR) muscle recession followed by vertical recti transposition. The final primary position alignment was satisfactory. Therefore, MR muscle recession alone is an effective first procedure of choice for mild-to-moderate esotropia in patients with MBS, whereas severe cases may further require the transposition of vertical recti. As it is a congenital condition, early surgical intervention may prevent amblyopia and provide an opportunity for the development of binocular single vision.

Natural plant-derived extracellular vesicle-like particles (EVPs) have emerged as biocompatible carriers for bioactive molecules. Among various medicinal plants screened, <i>Perilla frutescens</i> leaf-derived EVPs (PLEVPs) exhibited strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. By incorporating PLEVPs into a hydrogel formulation, we enhanced their stability, retention at psoriatic lesions, and transdermal delivery efficiency. In\u00a0vivo studies demonstrated that the PLEVPs markedly alleviated psoriasis symptoms in both preventive and therapeutic mouse models, outperforming conventional treatments. This effect was attributed to reduced oxidative stress, modulation of Treg cells, and promotion of keratinocyte apoptosis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed enrichment of the interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathway, a major driver of psoriasis, while small RNA sequencing identified pab-miR396a-5p, an endogenous microRNA (miRNA) within PLEVPs, as a key regulator. Mechanistic studies showed that pab-miR396a-5p targets the 3'-untranslated region of plant heat shock protein 83a, a homolog of mammalian heat shock protein 90, leading to the suppression of nuclear factor-kappa B and Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling, inhibiting the IL-17 signaling pathway.

Mitophagy plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial quantity and quality and is closely associated with the onset and progression of IVDD. Well-documented region-specific mitophagy mechanisms in IVDD are guiding the development of therapeutic strategies. In the nucleus pulposus (NP), impaired mitochondria lead to apoptosis, oxidative stress, senescence, extracellular matrix degradation and synthesis, excessive autophagy, inflammation, mitochondrial instability, and pyroptosis, with key regulatory targets including AMPK, PGC-1\u03b1, SIRT1, SIRT3, Progerin, p65, Mfn2, FOXO3, NDUFA4L2, SLC39A7, ITG\u03b15/\u03b21, Nrf2, and NLRP3 inflammasome. In the annulus fibrosus (AF), mitochondrial damage induces apoptosis and oxidative stress mediated by PGC-1\u03b1, while in the cartilage endplate (CEP), mitochondrial dysfunction similarly triggers apoptosis and oxidative stress. These mechanistic insights highlight therapeutic strategies such as activating Parkin-dependent and Ub-independent mitophagy pathways for NP, enhancing Parkin-dependent mitophagy for AF, and targeting Parkin-mediated mitophagy for CEP. These strategies include the use of natural ingredients, hormonal modulation, gene editing technologies, targeted compounds, and manipulation of related proteins.

BPD results from complex interactions among genetic factors, environmental exposures, and neonatal stressors. Key findings suggest that intrauterine hypoxia, hyperoxia, and nutrition can lead to epigenetic alterations, affecting gene expression and methylation, which may serve as biomarkers for early BPD detection. RUNX3 is identified as a critical transcription factor influencing lung development and inflammation, while changes in DNA methylation and histone dynamics in cord blood are linked to immune dysregulation associated with BPD. The role of m6A RNA methylation regulators from the IGF2BP family affects mRNA stability and gene expression relevant to BPD. Additionally, specific histones and microRNAs, particularly from the miR-17\u223c92 cluster, are implicated in pulmonary development and vascular regulation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), such as MALAT1, also play a role in gene regulation via competitive endogenous RNA networks, indicating their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

However, current additive liquid metal (LM) patterning methods face limitations in achieving high-throughput, high-resolution, and high-density LM wiring. Here, a subtractive LM patterning method has been developed to meet all these requirements simultaneously. The innovative method involves parallel filling a single continuous microfluidic mesh network with LM that short-circuits all the pins and pads of a circuit, followed by parallel cutting of the unwanted short-circuited interconnections using hydrochloric acid (HCl) vapor. Cutting locations are pre-defined by designing narrower intersecting channels, leveraging capillary force for precise filling and cutting. The process was characterized using a multi-dimensional parametric study with varying LM line widths and HCl concentrations, and in-situ impedance measurements to assess insulation performance. To showcase its high-throughput capabilities, a mock circuit was used to successfully generate complex LM interconnects that connected hundreds of electrical pads. Lastly, a stretchable LM circuit, fabricated using the subtractive LM patterning method, was integrated with a micro-LED array, highlighting the practical application of this new technology in creating massively parallel LM wirings in complex, heterogeneous, and stretchable electronic circuits.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "09", "day": "18"}}, {"article_title": "The complete chloroplast genome and phylogenetic analysis of <i>Cinnamomum daphnoides</i> (Laurales: Lauraceae).", "article_abstract": "This study presents the complete chloroplast genome of <i>Cinnamomum daphnoides</i> (154,121 bp, GC 39.2%), a newly recorded species in China, revealing a typical quadripartite structure: a large single-copy region (93,688 bp, GC 37.9%), a small single-copy region (18,929 bp, GC 33.9%), and two inverted repeats (20,752 bp each, GC 44.3%).

Elevated NH<sub>3</sub> deposition can result in various detrimental ecological and environmental consequences. Traditionally, researchers have employed methods such as static fumigation, dynamic fumigation using high-precision mass flow meters or standard gas cylinders, and free air enrichment to investigate vegetation responses to NH<sub>3</sub> deposition. However, these approaches may suffer from inaccuracies, high costs, or technical complexity. In order to address this issue, we developed the Syringe Pump Gas Distribution (SPGD) system, a cost-effective new method for simulating NH<sub>3</sub>/<sup>15</sup>NH<sub>3</sub> deposition. This system allows for precise and stable mixing of NH<sub>3</sub>/<sup>15</sup>NH<sub>3</sub> stored in a syringe with air using a microinjection pump. The resulting mixture is then utilized to simulate NH<sub>3</sub>/<sup>15</sup>NH<sub>3</sub> deposition. With just one 20 ml syringe, a single SPGD system can simulate NH<sub>3</sub> deposition flux ranging from 0 to 31.74 mg N m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> (equivalent to 0 - 116 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) over an area of 0.36 m<sup>2</sup>.

In this review, we present how the manipulation of the F.I.T.T. components can alter the acute and chronic cardiorespiratory, metabolic, perceptual, and affective responses and adaptations to intense interval exercise training. From this evidence, it appears that the duration of the exercise bout and recovery interval are critical parameters for the manipulation of almost all acute responses, enabling periodization of intense interval exercise training, and promoting optimal adaptations and exercise adherence. In addition, a considerable level of adaptations may be achieved with training frequencies as low as once or twice per week and with lower than maximal intensities, adding to the feasibility of this exercise mode.

Without a clear understanding of how fungi respond to global change drivers, mitigation plans-required for biodiversity and ecosystem service conservation and restoration-are impossible to develop. In this study we asked the following: (1) how does the fungal community respond to the individual and interactive effects of physical disturbance and drought in a heterogeneous dryland landscape comprised of drought-adapted shrubs separated by adjacent open areas of soil, and (2) what are the larger scale impacts of this response? We assessed fungal communities (using fungal-specific DNA metabarcoding analyses) of surface soil samples in an in situ global change experiment that included disturbance and drought in a full factorial design in the northern extent of the Chihuahuan Desert. We found that the fungal community was spatially heterogenous and remarkably resistant to disturbance and drought. We also show that dryland soils harbor high shares of facultative pathogenic and obligately pathogenic fungal taxa, with several concerning taxa reaching high relative abundances under drought. Our results suggest that the fungal community is highly influenced by microclimatic conditions associated with the presence or absence of vegetation. Moreover, our results imply that the fungal community in our experiment was already adapted to the magnitude of stress imposed by two years of experimental disturbance and drought treatments.

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are promising methods for the removal of organic microcontaminants in the environment. Biogenic manganese oxides (BMO) are reported as catalysts due to their transition metal nature, and are also readily generated by manganese-oxidizing microorganisms in the natural environment, and therefore their roles and effects in AOPs-based environmental remediation should be investigated. However, biogenic iron-manganese oxides (BFMO) are actually generated rather than BMO due to the coexistence of ferrous ions which can be oxidized to iron oxides. Therefore, this study produced BFMO originating from a highly efficient manganese-oxidizing fungus Cladosporium sp. XM01 and chose peroxymonosulfate (PMS) as a typical oxidant for the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA), a model organic micropollutant. Characterization results indicate that the formed BFMO was amorphous with a low crystallinity. The BFMO/PMS system achieved a high degradation performance that 85 % BPA was rapidly degraded within 60 min, and therefore the contribution of BFMO cannot be ignored during PMS-based environmental remediation. Different from the findings of previous studies (mostly radicals and singlet oxygen), the degradation mechanism was first proven as a 100 % electron-transfer pathway mediated by high-valence Mn under acidic conditions provided by PMS.

Special emphasis was paid on the analysis of thermal effects through a robust modeling approach. The results showed that a synergy index of 6.26 and a degradation rate of 56.71 % could be obtained by the HC-PDS process, respectively, when the reaction conditions were optimized.

Notably, DTX administration on d7 markedly curtailed tumor growth, as evidenced by bioluminescence and histological analysis, indicating its effectiveness in reducing bone metastases. Bone metastases were more established in animals treated with later DTX administration and ZOL, but still reduced compared to no treatment. When considering bone quality, we found that both the organic and mineral phases of bone are impacted by DTX treatment. Tumor-bearing animals exhibited decreased hydroxyproline/proline ratios reflecting change in collagen metabolism compared to healthy controls, but these decreases were only significant with no treatment or DTX administration on d14. This suggests a positive impact of early DTX treatment similar to ZOL on bone quality from an organic perspective. As well, increased CaMean and CaPeak reflecting the degree of calcification was found in healthy rats treated early with DTX, similar to that seen with ZOL compared to the tumor-bearing treated groups.

This study conducted in Thailand's wildlife stations aimed to assess the risks of CDV introduction to captive tiger populations. A stochastic quantitative risk assessment model was employed to determine the pathways and estimate the risk probabilities through humans, animal reservoirs, and fomites. The final risk probability of entry, obtained from a combination of six entry pathways, indicated that the absence of measures resulted in a relatively high risk at 0.858. The sensitivity analysis identified CDV-contaminated human hands, followed by other CDV-infected wild animals, and CDV-contaminated equipment, as the most influential pathways of CDV spread. Risk probabilities were compared among those without intervention, with routine intervention at wildlife stations, and with full intervention implementation. Implementing all interventions at the captive wildlife stations significantly reduced the risk of CDV introduction. These interventions included control measures such as quarantining and isolating infected animals and providing treatment to reduce infectiousness. Preventive measures included screening tests for healthy individuals for early detection of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic cases, preventing further spread or complications, CDV vaccination campaigns, and promoting hand hygiene among staff and visitors. Environmental interventions involve restricting dogs and cats from accessing tiger enclosures, disinfecting animal transport vehicles, using separate equipment for each cage, etc. Together, these interventions lowered the median risk of CDV introduction to 0.089, representing an 89.6% risk reduction. This approach assessed CDV infection risks and adapted interventions to specific situations at wildlife stations. Consistent implementation of these measures is essential to minimize CDV spread.

Saliva samples were obtained from 19 children aged 1-29 months, of both sexes and seeded by both methods, obtaining the MS CFU numbers. The ANOVA test was used to statistically analyze the microbiological results, and the Z-test and chi-square test were used to analyze the behavioral assessment (\u03b1= 0,05%). 63.1% and 57.9% of children had MS in their saliva, using the saliva collection techniques with a spatula and a pipette, respectively. The number of CFUs was an average of 10.47 for saliva collected with the spatula and 7.32 for saliva collected with the pipette, however, there was no statistical difference between the methods (p=0.696653). Comparing the ages 1-6 months and 18-29 months, the older children showed higher CFU numbers, for both methods (p=0.000383). The clinical assessment of the child's behavior demonstrated a significant statistical difference between the two methods, with more positive behavior for the spatula (p<0.001).

Fifteen dental implants were immersed in five test solutions with different fluoride concentrations and pH values. Three control implants were scanned using a scanning electron microscope and fifteen test implants were also scanned after their immersion in the test solutions. The immersion solutions were analyzed for titanium particles/ions size-range and amount. The uptake of titanium particles by macrophages and expression of Il-1 \u03b2 and IL-8 following their exposure to titanium particles were investigated. Test solutions with high fluoride and acidity resulted in the release of micro-size titanium particles (4551.7 \u00b1 114.5 nm and 2783 \u00b1 101.13 nm); while those with low fluoride, neutral pH, and alkaline environment resulted in the release of nano-size titanium particles (431.2 \u00b1 80.6 nm, 448.3 \u00b1 112 nm, and 484.5 \u00b1 85.3 nm respectively). There was an increase in the uptake of nanoparticles by macrophages without altering their membrane integrity. The increase in expression of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 by M0 macrophages after exposure to titanium dioxide particles may facilitate our understanding of immune cell population-specific molecular events deriving the peri-implant inflammation in response to titanium particles.

We conducted a retrospective and prospective cohort study involving 509 mother-child dyads tested simultaneously for IgG anti-nucleocapsid antibodies during universal neonatal screening. There were 341 seronegative dyads and 168 seropositive ones. Seropositive neonates were retested two to three months later. We examined the association of neonatal serological status and IgG concentrations with gestational mRNA vaccination, timing of maternal infection, neonatal conditions, and gender. Gestational SARS-CoV-2 infection predicted neonatal IgG seropositivity (OR=3.97; 95%CI=2.69-5.88). Maternal infection in the first, second, or third trimester was associated with progressively greater seropositivity in neonates (34.4%, 51.6%, and 58.2%, respectively; p=0.03).

However, this assumption can be problematic when it does not hold or when measurement error cannot be reasonably classified as part of the nonshared environment. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, we demonstrate the need for improvement in the conventional structural equation modeling (SEM) used for estimating heritability when applied to trait data with measurement errors. The critical issue revolves around an assumption concerning measurement errors in twin studies. In cases where traits are measured using samples, data is aggregated during preprocessing, with only a centrality measure (e.g., mean) being used for modeling. Additionally, measurement errors resulting from sampling are assumed to be part of the nonshared environment and are thus overlooked in heritability estimation. Consequently, the presence of intra-individual variability remains concealed. Moreover, recommended sample sizes are typically based on the assumption of no measurement errors. <b>Results:</b> We argue that measurement errors in the form of intra-individual variability are an intrinsic limitation of finite sampling and should not be considered as part of the nonshared environment. Previous studies have shown that the intra-individual variability of psychometric effects is significantly larger than the inter-individual counterpart. Here, to demonstrate the appropriateness and advantages of our hierarchical linear modeling approach in heritability estimation, we utilize simulations as well as a real dataset from the ABCD (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development) study. Moreover, we showcase the following analytical insights for data containing non-negligible measurement errors: i) The conventional SEM may underestimate heritability. ii) A hierarchical model provides a more accurate assessment of heritability. iii) Large samples, exceeding 100 observations or thousands of twins, may be necessary to reduce imprecision. <b>Discussion:</b> Our study highlights the impact of measurement error on heritability estimation and introduces a hierarchical model as a more accurate alternative.

By simultaneously capturing joint motion using five distinct marker sets, we were able to confirm the presence of visible differences in the raw kinematic outputs prior to data optimisation, despite their representing the same underlying motion. We subsequently implemented the REference FRame Alignment MEthod (REFRAME) to account for signal differences linked to inconsistent local reference frame orientations. <b>Results and Discussion:</b> After REFRAME optimisation, improved convergence of the kinematic signals was observed, confirming that the differences observed in raw signals stemmed primarily from differing reference frame orientations, rather than genuine variations in joint motion. This study highlights REFRAME's potential to enhance comparability across biomechanical datasets, thus facilitating robust inter-laboratory comparisons and supporting reliable interpretations of data in clinical and research applications.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "02"}}, {"article_title": "Effects of vibration training combined with kinesio taping on delayed onset muscle soreness of athletes' knee joints post-DOMS induction: a randomised controlled trial.", "article_abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of vibration training combined with kinesio taping on delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) in athletes.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "02"}}, {"article_title": "Feasibility study on the application of HD-sEMG-based force estimation technology in the assessment of hand dysfunction in cerebral palsy.", "article_abstract": "In response to the demand for a quantifiable means for assessing hand dysfunction in cerebral palsy (CP), this paper proposed and conducted a novel high-density (HD)-surface electromyography (sEMG)-based muscle force estimation framework.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "02"}}, {"article_title": "Evaluation of the <i>Salmonella</i> type 3 secretion system (T3SS) as part of a protein production platform for space biology applications.", "article_abstract": "As interest in space exploration and <i>in situ</i> resource utilization grows, the potential to leverage synthetic biology and engineered microorganisms has garnered significant attention.

Diminished microvascular perfusion, despite adequate total blood flow, is a key pathophysiology in ischaemia-mediated acute kidney injury. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) could allow objective assessment of microvascular perfusion during renal NMP. Blood-based NMP was performed on porcine kidneys (circulatory death model) and human kidneys declined for transplant (preclinical). CEUS was performed with a contrast bolus into the NMP circuit arterial limb. Microvascular perfusion quality was quantified and z-score normalisation allowed combination of metrics and regions into an overall \"CEUS-score.\" In porcine kidneys, inferior microvascular perfusion of cortex and medulla correlated with increased urinary NGAL (Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) and histological DNA-fragmentation (a hallmark of apoptosis).

Understanding the morphological adaptations of the Achilles tendon and calf muscles is crucial. <b>Objective:</b> This study compares the stiffness of the Achilles tendon and calf muscles between triathletes and physically active controls, while identifying differences in the superficial, middle, and deep layers of the calf muscles across and within these groups. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted with 42 participants divided into four groups: 10 male triathletes, 10 male controls, 11 female triathletes, and 11 female controls. Shear wave elastography assessed the stiffness of the Achilles tendon and calf muscles. <b>Results:</b> No between-group differences were found for the overall stiffness of the Achilles tendon and calf muscles.

In a therapeutic landscape where treatments are targeted to manage symptoms, gene editing therapy emerges as a promising approach to craft curative and lasting treatments for these patients, often referred to as \"one-and-done\" therapeutics. CRISPR-dependent base editing enables the precise correction of genetic mutations by direct modification of DNA bases without creating potentially deleterious DNA double-strand breaks.

Artesunate (ART), an extract obtained from the traditional Chinese medicine Qinghaosu, has been shown to exhibit anti-cancer activity by inducing ferroptosis in cancer cells. While previous research has focused on incorporating ART monomer into drug delivery systems for enhanced cancer targeting, this study presents 2-methacryloyloxyethyl ART polymer (poly(ARTEMA)), a novel polymer synthesized from ART for the first time. Our goal was evaluation of poly(ARTEMA) anticancer potential on breast cancer cells. First, we synthesized ARTEMA using esterification followed by its polymerization using the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization method. We evaluated its mechanism of action, focusing on two key pathways: temperature-triggered singlet oxygen generation and ferrous ions (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) release, both of which contribute to ferroptosis. Our results demonstrate that poly(ARTEMA) selectively generates singlet oxygen and Fe<sup>2+</sup> due to the endoperoxide crosslinks, leading to cell death in breast cancer cells. We also investigated the anti-cancer potential of poly(ARTEMA) on breast cancer cells with and without a ferroptosis inhibitor. The IC<sub>50</sub> values were 125\u2009\u00b5M for the MCF-7 cancer cell line and 300\u2009\u00b5M for the normal MCF-10 cell line, indicating enhanced toxicity toward cancer cell lines.

The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of cold incubation (vernalization) periods of varying duration on the grain yield, biomass production, and phenology of MR, compared to a dual purpose annual winter wheat cultivar (AW: <i>Triticum aestivum</i> L), and the perennial intermediate wheatgrass (IWG: <i>Thinopyrum intermedium</i> (Host) Barkworth & D.R.

Magnetic resonance imaging has potential to link subtle pathophysiological alterations to clinical outcomes. Here, we review the state of the art of MRI research in adults with mild traumatic brain injury and provide recommendations to facilitate transition into clinical practice. Studies utilizing MRI can inform on pathophysiology of mild traumatic brain injury. They suggest presence of early cytotoxic and vasogenic oedema.

An individual prognosis for the course of the disease, in particular the development of cognitive and behavioural abnormalities, is not yet possible As part of our investigations, we focused on cognitive performance and behavioural abnormalities measured by the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and investigated possible prognostic biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid as well as modifiable factors such as nutrition and lung function. A retrospective data analysis of 99 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases examined between 2018 and 2021 at the Department for Neurodegenerative Diseases and Gerontopsychiatry at the University Hospital of Bonn, using Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen, revealed that elevated levels of total tau and phospho-tau 181 were associated with diminished performance of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis on the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen. Additionally, weight loss during the course of the disease has been observed to have a deleterious impact on cognitive performance. Moreover, we were able to demonstrate a previously insufficiently described correlation between abnormalities in the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen and low-normal thiamine levels in serum. The hypothesis that reduced lung function has a negative effect on cognitive performance was not supported by our findings. The initial onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, whether bulbar or spinal, does not appear to affect cognition and behaviour measured using Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen.

Fifteen healthy subjects performed three spelling tasks that involved choosing specific letters displayed on a computer screen by performing a ballistic dorsiflexion of the dominant foot. Electroencephalographic signals were recorded from 10 sites centered around Cz. Three conditions were tested to evaluate MRCP performance under varying task demands: a control condition using repeated selections of the letter \"O\" to isolate movement-related brain activity; a phrase spelling condition with structured text (\"HELLO IM FINE\") to simulate a meaningful spelling task with moderate cognitive load; and a random condition using a randomized sequence of letters to introduce higher task complexity by removing linguistic or semantic context.

Two experienced radiologists extracted the BI-RADS features from the largest cross-section of the lesions and axillary lymph nodes based on CEM and US images, creating three datasets. Each dataset will train six base models to predict axillary lymph nodes, with pathological results serving as the gold standard. The top three models were used to train the five ensemble models. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used to interpret the optimal model. The receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) and AUC were used to evaluate model performance.ResultsThis study involved 292 female patients, of whom 99 had axillary lymph node metastasis and 193 did not. The combination of CEM and ultrasound BI-RADS demonstrated the best performance in predicting axillary lymph node metastasis. Among these, the LightGBM achieved the highest AUC (0.762) and specificity (86.67%, while the ensemble model using RF as the meta-model had an AUC (0.754) and specificity (83.33%.

This method generates a melting curve by real-time monitoring of the changes in fluorescence signal as dsDNA melts during the heating process. The melting temperature serves as a fundamental indicator of sample characteristics in HRM analysis. During the initial stages of designing a new HRM experimental system, accurately predicting the Tm position of the established system can significantly enhance research efficiency. Currently, there is a limited number of studies focused on the prediction of Tm values in HRM analysis, with varying levels of predictive accuracy. The nearest-neighbor method model can well reflect the interaction of adjacent base pairs. Therefore, we combined the nearest neighbor method model and applied parameters such as enthalpy change, entropy change, GC content and number of base pairs of the DNA sequence to derive a new empirical formula for predicting Tm values. In this study, five species of seawater diatoms were selected as the research subjects. Four specific primers were employed to amplify the extracted DNA through PCR, and the resulting amplified products underwent HRM analysis and Sanger sequencing. Based on the obtained DNA sequences, we calculated the corresponding GC content, number of base pairs, enthalpy change and entropy change, combined with the Tm value obtained from the experiment. Finally, the following formula for predicting Tm value is obtained: (1) When the GC content is 40%\u2264GC content\u226460%: Tm=\u0394H/\u0394S-0.27GC%-(150+2n)/n-273.15; (2) When the GC content is <40%: Tm=\u0394H/\u0394S-GC%/3-(150+2n)/n-273.15. After that, the DNA sequences amplified using two other specific primers were verified, and the predicted Tm values were compared with the measured values. The average error was within 1 \u00b0C.The results show that the formula obtained in the study can accurately predict the Tm value, which can be effectively used to identify the species of unknown samples.Therefore, this Tm value prediction method provides new methods and ideas for solving practical problems in multiple related fields.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "16"}}, {"article_title": "The ongoing antibiotic resistance and carbapenemase encoding genotypes surveillance.

Cointegration vector validates existence of long-term relationship of which an inverse interaction between temperature and SOI with cases and a direct relationship of OI with cases. Short-term equilibrium displays a robust causality among variables. Interaction of case with case demonstrates positive coefficients at lags -3, -7, and -8. Interaction of SOI with case shows negative coefficients on SOI variable at lags -3 and -4 and positive coefficient on the case variable at lag -1. OI equation with OI variable shows unique interaction of negative coefficients on OI variable at lags -1, -3, and -4. However, it produced positive coefficient on OI variable at lag -9.

The capture-mark-release method was used to trap rodents from 15 sites in Nairobi National Park's savannah, forest, and riverine vegetation types during the dry and wet seasons. The diversity, species richness and abundance were determined from the trappings. From 56 rodents trapped, five species were identified namely: Lemniscomys striatus, Hylomyscus sp, Rattus rattus, Mus mus and Otomys tropicalis. Rodent diversity at NNP was low (Simpson=0.7130; Shannon Weiner=1.40; Brillouin index=1.27) while Pielou's species evenness, was moderate=0.44 indicating near equity in species distribution.

In response, how do people interpret their lives and act within the conflict context between social realities and political forces? On the basis of semi-structured interviews with teachers in different types of schools, this paper explores how teachers interpret meritocracy and navigate it in their teaching practices. The results indicate that teachers show a dual attitude toward meritocracy. On the one hand, they believe that effort and ability are crucial to occupational and educational success, yet on the other hand, they also acknowledge the influence of guanxi on employment and the noticeable educational disparities caused by family background. Teachers have different approaches to balancing meritocratic and nonmeritocratic factors in their teaching. Teachers who limit their responsibilities regarding student growth offer verbal advice. The majority of teachers guide students to focus on working to redress the gap derived from nonmeritocratic factors while also warning students not to place too much hope on agency. Teachers' practices inevitably contribute to social inequality. This paper underscores that in an environment lacking redistribution mechanisms, meritocracy for teachers is more of a pragmatic calculation than a belief.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "16"}}, {"article_title": "Protocol for a prospective cohort study on congenital heart disease in neonates across varied altitudes in Sichuan province, China.", "article_abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most prevalent congenital disorder, contributing significantly to neonate mortality.

Although such attacks are rare, they are typically highly publicized, and leave residents concerned about the presence of coyotes in their neighborhoods. Wildlife managers often promote hazing to mitigate human-coyote conflicts, but this technique for intimidating animals has been studied in coyotes only recently and there are few guidelines for its implementation. We developed a community-based hazing program in Edmonton (Alberta, Canada) implemented by volunteers who patrolled their neighborhoods while recording coyotes and coyote attractants. When coyotes were observed, volunteers walked towards the coyotes and recorded their overt reaction and flight initiation distances. If coyotes did not retreat when volunteers were within 40 m of the animal, volunteers ran towards the coyote while shouting and throwing weighted tennis balls towards the animals. Over two field seasons, we recruited, trained, and engaged 120 volunteers from 71 neighborhoods, who conducted 1598 patrols, observed coyotes in 175 instances, and conducted hazing 23 times. Coyotes retreated before volunteers were within 40 m during 124 (71%) of the observations and retreated immediately from 22 (96%) of the hazing events. We found no evidence that hazing changed subsequent measures of overt reaction or flight initiation distances by coyotes, perhaps because it was implemented too rarely, and its effects on the number or timing of subsequent coyote reports by members of the public were inconsistent. Our study emphasizes the rarity of close encounters with coyotes and the high frequency with which they retreat from human approaches and even directed attention by people. Our study supports the use of community-based hazing to reassure members of the public while potentially promoting wariness in coyotes.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "16"}}, {"article_title": "Determinants and barriers in early tuberculosis treatment in children at a primary health care facility in Kampala, Uganda; A mixed methods study.", "article_abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with childhood TB posing unique diagnostic challenges due to its pauci bacillary nature.

The best-known feature of BTB statutes is a \"screening ban:\" employers cannot inquire about a criminal record until they have made a conditional offer of employment. Many BTB statutes contain a less well-known \"use prohibition:\" employers cannot withdraw a conditional offer based on a criminal record unless that record is sufficiently related to fulfillment of potential job duties. In this paper we provide the first evidence of the association of BTB policies with variation in the progression of candidates through hiring phases after the screening process. We use unique applicant-level data obtained from an employer before and after it voluntarily implemented a BTB policy. We find that the enactment of the BTB policy has little or no association with the rate at which individuals with criminal records survive the candidate assessment process and receive conditional employment offers. Indeed, our findings suggest a modest indication of a negative association between the implementation of BTB policies and the hiring of individuals with prior convictions for specific offenses. The observed pattern could be explained if, after losing access to criminal history, employers increase their reliance on hiring criteria that are correlated to criminal history. We also find that the rate at which individuals with a criminal record survive a final background check does not change after the implementation of the joint BTB policies.

The study used the CCSM4 general circulation model along with two climate scenarios, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, for the 2050s and 2070s to predict the potential impact of climate change on the distribution of the species studied. The research findings indicated that the model performed effectively for prediction (AUC\u22650.9).

In this paper, we propose MuseumMaker, a method that enables the synthesis of images by following a set of customized styles in a never-end manner, and gradually accumulates these creative artistic works as a Museum. When facing with a new customization style, we develop a style distillation loss module to extract and learn the styles of the training data for new image generation task. It can minimize the learning biases caused by content of new training images, and address the catastrophic overfitting issue induced by few-shot images. To deal with catastrophic forgetting issue amongst past learned styles, we devise a dual regularization for shared-LoRA module to optimize the direction of model update, which could regularize the diffusion model from both weight and feature aspects, respectively. Meanwhile, to further preserve historical knowledge from past styles and address the limited representability of LoRA, we design a task-wise token learning module where a unique token embedding is learned to denote a new style.

Since the act of chewing is a very complex issue in the biomechanics of the masticatory system, the research and analysis of the obtained results were therefore limited to the first cycle. <b>Methods:</b> Determination of the peak energy and power of the muscles required: (1) preparation of food patterns, in the form of the function <i>F = f<i>(\u0394</i>h<i>)</i></i> (force (<i>F</i>) vs displacement (\u0394<i>h</i>)), based on experimental studies and (2) conducting numerical simulations using a 3D kinematic-dynamic model of the human masticatory system. <b>Results and Discussion:</b> Based on the results, the peak energy and power of the muscles were determined based on food patterns. A comparative analysis was also performed to evaluate the energy and peak power generated by the aforementioned muscles during symmetrical incisal biting vs unilateral chewing of the same food products. The results indicate that (1) food height and texture significantly affect muscle energy and (2) the masticatory and medial pterygoid muscles generate more incredible energy and peak power on the working side than on the non working side, while the opposite was observed for the temporalis muscle and (3) comparative analysis showed that food position on the dental arch has a more significant effect on muscle peak power for foods with high texture heterogeneity than for foods with low texture heterogeneity.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "01"}}, {"article_title": "Optimized strategies for developing high-speed muscle activity monitors utilizing multi-resolution energy operator.", "article_abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Electromyographic (EMG) activity monitoring constitutes the core of foundational research for the application of EMG signals in medical diagnostics, sports science, and human-machine interaction. However, the current research trend predominantly focuses on the recognition technologies of EMG signals, while the techniques for accurately detecting the onset and offset points of muscle activity-the change-point detection of EMG signals-have not received the necessary attention and thorough investigation. <b>Methods:</b> A novel method for EMG signal activity detection based on a variant version of the Teager-Kaiser energy operator (TKEO), namely the multi-resolution energy operator (MTEO), is proposed. Two strategies for constructing EMG activity monitors using MTEO are presented. One is a threshold-based detector (MEOTD) relying on signal baseline segment information, and the other is a detector mimicking the structure of a convolutional neural network (MEONND) without requiring prior knowledge of the signal. A semi-subjective evaluation model based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to evaluate the performance of the monitors on real EMG data. <b>Results and discussion:</b> The results show that the MTEO has stronger preprocessing ability for EMG signals, and that the MTEO-based monitors are more reliable and accurate. In particular, the MEONND can achieve both computational efficiency and accuracy simultaneously. The proposed method for EMG signal activity detection improves both detection quality and efficiency without increasing algorithm complexity.

To provide evidence on this matter, we leverage data from the European Social Survey, collected between 2002 and 2020 (<i>N</i> = 261,830) and examine how immigrants' self-reported values relate to their integration. Our analyses ask whether value assimilation predicts improvements in immigrants' occupational status, socialization, and political participation throughout 27 countries in the European Union.

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) constitute a fraction of immune cells that may infiltrate into the TME. The primary function of these T-cells is to detect and eliminate tumor cells. However, due to the immunosuppressive factors present in the TME primarily mediated by Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs), Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) as well as the tumor cells themselves, T-cells fail to differentiate into effector cells or become dysfunctional and are unable to eliminate the tumor. In addition, chronic antigen stimulation within the TME also leads to a phenomenon, first identified in chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice, where the T-cells become exhausted and lose their effector functions. Exhausted T-cells (Tex) are characterized by the presence of remarkably conserved inhibitory receptors, transcription and signaling factors and the downregulation of key effector molecules.

In recent years, this microorganism has acquired resistance to various antibiotics, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare carbapenem-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> (CRAB) a critical priority microorganism requiring urgent attention and the development of new therapeutic options. Here, we screened for prophages in 158 genomes of <i>A. baumannii</i>, comprising 139 complete genomes from the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC), and 19 newly sequenced clinical isolates. Additionally, we conducted phylogenetic analyses of prophages, highlighting their diversity and local clustering. The analyzed genomes harbored at least two prophage regions, resulting in the identification of a total of 950 prophage regions, of which 348 were considered complete prophages through software analysis and manual curation, while the remainder may represent prophage remnants. The complete prophages ranged from 28.6 to 103.9 kbp, with an average GC content of 39%.

Since the publication of the American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology classification criteria for APS, several authors have emphasized the difference between \"classification\" and \"diagnosis\" as a potential pitfall for clinicians. In addition to challenges associated with the diagnosis of APS, there are many unresolved areas in understanding pathogenesis and in the management of both thrombotic and obstetric APS. Although APS is an antibody-mediated autoimmune disease, secondary thrombosis prevention is achieved by anticoagulation, mainly with vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, rather than immunomodulation. Evidence is convincing for the use of vitamin K antagonists in triple-positive APS with venous thromboembolism. However, the best anticoagulant approach in the management of venous thromboembolism patients with single or dual positive aPL is not clear. Management of patients with stroke or arterial thrombosis with aPL remains a major unresolved issue, although some guidelines recommend the use of warfarin rather than antiplatelet therapy as the first-line treatment of stroke in APS.

In the present study, we investigated whether edonerpic MA accelerates functional recovery after SCI in non-human primates. Six adult monkeys (<i>Macaca fuscata</i>) received a unilateral SCI between the C6 and C7 segment. After the SCI, upper limb motor function was immediately impaired and the animals were assigned to receive vehicle (<i>n</i> = 3) or 3\u2005mg/kg/day edonerpic maleate (<i>n</i> = 3) by intramuscular injection for 2 months.

The motor representation of wrist territory at contralesional M1 was larger in the edonerpic MA-treated group than in the control group. We concluded that edonerpic MA accelerates the recovery of grasping movements after SCI, accompanied by cortical somatotopic reorganization.

Experiment 2 was performed on six dairy camels in late lactation (weight: 460\u202f\u00b1\u202f55.15\u202fkg; age: 10.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.4\u202fyears; parity: 3.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0; average milk yield: 3.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7\u202fL/day). External teat measurements (length, barrel, and apex diameters) were recorded with a caliper. Pre-and post-milking teat-end thickness (TET) were evaluated with a cutimeter at 2\u202fcm from the teat end. Ultrasound imaging was performed pre-and post-milking to determine TCL, TWT, TCD, and teat apex diameter (TAD). Milk ejection time and total milking duration were recorded. Residual milk volume was estimated after an injection of 10\u202fIU oxytocin. Milk samples were taken for somatic cell count (SCC). The results showed that only 50 teats out of 120 observations exhibited milk flow at a vacuum up to 70\u202fkPa. Teats were divided into three groups: Group 1 included easy-opening teats that opened at a vacuum level of less than 30\u202fkPa; group 2 included teats that were hard to open, requiring a higher vacuum (31 up to 69\u202fkPa); and group 3 included teats that did not show milk flow at a vacuum higher than 70\u202fkPa. The mean VLOTS for groups 1 and 2 were 19.39\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.66\u202fkPa and 47.13\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.14\u202fkPa, respectively. VLOTS was positively and highly correlated with TCL, TWT, and TSWT (<i>r</i>\u202f=\u202f0.71, <i>r</i>\u202f=\u202f0.62, and <i>r</i>\u202f=\u202f0.51, respectively, <i>p</i>\u202f<\u202f0.001) and negatively correlated with teat length and diameter (<i>r</i>\u202f=\u202f-0.50 and <i>r</i>\u202f=\u202f-0.30, respectively, <i>p</i>\u202f<\u202f0.01). Observation of teats immediately after cluster removal revealed a 15.4% decrease in TET. TCL and TWT increased by 20.3 and 40.5%, respectively, while TCD and TAD decreased by 40.3 and 19.9%, respectively, after milking. This suggests the stretching of the teat extremity and congestion of the teat barrel wall. The mean SCC recorded in this study was 149.6 10<sup>3</sup> cells/mL, varying from 37.5 10<sup>3</sup> cells/mL to 287.5 10<sup>3</sup> cells/mL. This study confirms the need for a high vacuum level to overcome the sphincter barrier in dromedary camels.

For baleen whales, in regions where high productivity and prolific fisheries overlap, entanglement is emerging as a component of their life history: In some of these regions, entanglement comprises the leading cause of serious injury and mortality. Additionally, up to 80% of whales carry scars indicative of entanglement, and associated declines in long-term health are reducing fecundity. Here, we describe behavioral traits seen in humpback whales during entanglement incidents. Specifically, we focus on reports of humpback whales that have remained in association with entangled whales during these incidents and apply the term \"companion whales\" in reference to these whales. Reports reviewed include a detailed account of a recent incident observed in Hawaiian waters, a compilation of 62 accounts of similar behavior extracted from 414 reports of entanglement events provided by regional entanglement response networks, and a series of six reports associated with whaling activities.

We also find that age, gender, duration as a market vendor, and other savings avenues are vital for accessibility to financial services offered by the FNPF. We also find that while market vendors are aware of saving and saving benefits with FNPF, there is a lack of intention for them to adopt the current FNPF product.

KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis and GO (Gene Ontology) analysis were used to investigate the GREM1 related molecular events, and then constructed a PPI (Protein-Protein Interaction) network via the STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interaction Genes/Proteins) online tool. Western blot was performed to investigate the indicated protein expression. In the present study, our results showed that GREM1 tended to be upregulated in various cancers, which would correlate with the poor prognosis. Mechanistically, our results showed that GREM1 involve in regulating the ECM-receptor interaction pathway, upregulation of MMP activity, angiogenesis, and immune cell infiltration. In vitro studies, our results further showed that BMP agonist significantly decreased the protein level of GREM1 in GES-1 cells and BGC cells, which accompanied by inhibiting migration and proliferation in GES-1 cells and BGC cells. BMP inhibitor significantly promoted GREM1 expression and migration in BGC cells, but not GES-1 cells. GREM1 might serve as a potential and promising prognostic biomarker for drug development and cancer treatment.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "15"}}, {"article_title": "Outcomes Evidence Must Keep Up with the Implementation of the 4Ms Framework to Ensure Age-Friendly Health System Transformation.", "article_abstract": "The Age-Friendly Health System (AFHS) movement was conceptualized as a transformative solution to reliably deliver evidence-based care to older adults. Guided by the 4Ms framework: What Matters, Mobility, Mentation, and Medication, AFHS healthcare systems have been given the flexibility to tailor 4Ms interventions and care processes to their context, preferences and populations. This flexibility has facilitated the widespread adoption of 4Ms care. However, as our understanding of 4Ms implementation grows, evidence of the impact of 4Ms care on outcomes must keep up with implementation to ensure AFHS transformation. It is only through assessing the 4Ms as a whole and understanding the interplay between the Ms in relationship to outcomes that we can understand: (1) value-generation to-date, (2) how variation in 4Ms implementation can maximize equitable value realization, and (3) if, and how, to expand the framework most effectively. We propose seven strategies to catalyze the generation and dissemination of robust evidence to support AFHS transformation. These strategies are organized around activities that individual healthcare delivery organizations, researchers and evaluators, and other key informants can pursue. Expanding evidence generation and disseminating findings using these proposed strategies will support the 4Ms framework as an effective vehicle for improving health outcomes for older adults.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "15"}}, {"article_title": "Unlocking chickpea flour potential: AI-powered prediction for quality assessment and compositional characterisation.", "article_abstract": "The growing demand for sustainable, nutritious, and environmentally friendly food sources has placed chickpea flour as a vital component in the global shift to plant-based diets. However, the inherent variability in the composition of chickpea flour, influenced by genetic diversity, environmental conditions, and processing techniques, poses significant challenges to standardisation and quality control. This study explores the integration of deep learning models with near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to improve the accuracy and efficiency of chickpea flour quality assessment. Using a dataset comprising 136 chickpea varieties, the research compares the performance of several state-of-the-art deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), and compares the most effective model, CNN, against the traditional Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) method. The results demonstrate that CNN-based models outperform PLSR, providing more accurate predictions for key quality attributes such as protein content, starch, soluble sugars, insoluble fibres, total lipids, and moisture levels. The study highlights the potential of AI-enhanced NIR spectroscopy to revolutionise quality assessment in the food industry by offering a non-destructive, rapid, and reliable method for analysing chickpea flour. Despite the challenges posed by the limited dataset, deep learning models exhibit capabilities that suggest that further advancements would allow their industrial applicability.

Adult patients who received an ICD, identified by the\u00a0International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10<sup>th</sup> Revision (ICD-10)\u00a0codes, were included. Outcomes were compared between patients with and without underlying liver cirrhosis. The primary outcome was all-cause inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes included ischemic cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), major bleeding (gastrointestinal, intracranial, pulmonary, and other bleeding), packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion, pericardial complications (pericardial effusion, hemopericardium, or pericardial tamponade), acute kidney injury (AKI), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), length of stay, and total hospital charges. Results Among 264,518 patients who underwent defibrillator implantation, 3,507 patients (1.3%) had liver cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis experienced significantly higher inpatient mortality (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.29, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.70-3.08, P<0.001), major bleeding (aOR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.97-2.91, P<0.001), pRBC transfusion (aOR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.81-2.64, P<0.001), pericardial complications (aOR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.05-1.79, P=0.02), and AKI (aOR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.29-1.59, P<0.001). No significant difference was observed in the incidence of ischemic CVA (aOR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.33-2.43, p=0.83), but there was a reduced incidence of AMI (aOR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.59-0.84, P<0.001) in patients with cirrhosis.

Detection methods for sialic acid have been developed, and fluorescent labeling of sialic acids with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB) is the best method for its analysis. However, identifying and quantifying sialic acids using mass spectrometry (MS) remains difficult because of the diversity of sialic acids, including <i>O</i>-acetylation. In this study, we initially focused on enhancing the liquid chromatography (LC) separation of DMB-labeled sialic acids in bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM).

In the aggregation process, \u03b1-synuclein transitions from its native disordered/\u03b1-helical form to a \u03b2-sheet-rich structure, forming oligomers and protofibrils that accumulate into Lewy bodies, in a process that is thought to underlie neurodegeneration.

This study aimed to investigate biochemical changes associated with \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, focusing on lipid changes, using Raman spectroscopy coupled with machine learning.

Cognitively normal (CN), biomarker-positive (CN)/BM+individuals were identified using a tTau: A\u03b242 ratio > 0.24, determined by Gaussian mixture models. CN/BM+ individuals (<i>n</i> = 134) were classified as having asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AsymAD), while CN, biomarker-negative (CN/BM-) individuals served as controls (<i>n</i> = 134).

In humans, heterozygous loss of function variants in the gene encoding it (<i>GRIN2A</i>) increase the risk of epilepsy, intellectual disability and schizophrenia. Haploinsufficient mouse models show electrophysiological abnormalities and thus to improve and widen understanding of the pathogenesis of <i>GRIN2A</i>-associated disorders in humans, this study aimed to assess the impact of <i>Grin2a</i> absence and haploinsufficiency on core neuronal and synaptic properties in genetically modified rats. Electrophysiological whole-cell current- and voltage-clamp recordings were made from CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices from wild-type and <i>Grin2a</i> heterozygous (<i>Grin2a<sup>+/-</sup></i> ) and homozygous (<i>Grin2a<sup>-/-</sup></i> ) knock out rats aged postnatal day 27-34. While reduced levels or absence of GluN2A did not affect neuronal excitability or intrinsic membrane properties in both <i>Grin2a<sup>+/-</sup></i> and <i>Grin2a<sup>-/-</sup></i> rats, we found a reduced frequency of miniature excitatory post synaptic currents and a reduced density of proximal dendrites suggestive of a reduced number of excitatory synapses. Recordings from CA1 neurons in slices prepared from <i>Grin2a<sup>+/-</sup></i> and <i>Grin2a<sup>-/-</sup></i> rats revealed there was a reduced ratio of the current mediated by NMDA receptors compared to AMPA receptors, while in <i>Grin2a<sup>-/-</sup></i> recordings, there was a slowing of the decay time-constant of the NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents. Moreover, neither summation of sub-threshold excitatory postsynaptic potentials nor summation of supra-threshold excitatory postsynaptic potentials to initiate action potential firing in CA1 pyramidal neurons indicated any dependence on GluN2A. We conclude that reduced levels of GluN2A alters the kinetics of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic events and dendritic structure of CA1 neurons, but do not affect several other core neuronal functions. These relatively subtle changes are consistent with the largely intact neural functioning of the majority of humans carrying <i>GRIN2A</i> loss of function variants.

Then, we used two-step MR and MVMR to estimate the indirect effect of these mediators. <b>Results:</b> We identified genetically predicted 1-SD (3.71 years) higher education attainment (OR: 0.632; [95% confidential interval (CI): 0.464-0.860]); qualifications (OR: 0.418; [95% CI: 0.245-0.714]); or cognitive performance (OR: 0.770; [95% CI: 0.652-0.909]) was associated with lower risk of PPD, and the causal effects of education attainment (OR: 0.407; [95% CI: 0.214-0.773]) on PPD were independent of qualifications and cognition. Childbearing age (<i>\u03b2</i>: -0.497; [95% CI: -0.788-0.238]; <i>p</i>\u2009 < 0.001) and neuroticism score (<i>\u03b2</i>: -0.07; [95% CI: -0.120-0.030]; <i>p</i>\u2009 < 0.001) were identified as mediators of the association between education attainment and PPD. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results suggested the predominant impact of education attainment on PPD independent of qualifications and cognition. Education level mainly affects PPD by changing the childbearing age. <b>Trial Registration:</b> Chinese Clinical Trial Registry identifier: ChiCTR2000033433.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "02", "day": "20"}}, {"article_title": "Predicting Conversion From Unipolar Depression to Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia: A 10-Year Retrospective Cohort Study on 12,182 Inpatients.", "article_abstract": "<b>Background:</b> The initial stages of bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) often exhibit depressive symptoms and syndromes, leading to potential misdiagnosis and treatment for unipolar depression (UD). However, no consensus exists on individualized and time-varying intervenable conversion predictors for both BD and SCZ. <b>Methods:</b> This study examined the rate of true conversion from UD to BD and SCZ, considering factors such as sex, family history of mental illness, psychotic features, recurrent depression, and treatment patterns. The objective was to develop predictive models for short-, medium-, and long-term risk stratification for BD/SCZ conversion. Data were extracted from electronic medical records (EMRs) between January 2009 and December 2020 in a large academic medical center-based health system in China. Participants included 12,182 depressive inpatients without previous or comorbid diagnoses of BD and SCZ. The outcome measure was a subsequent admission record with a diagnostic code reflective of BD or SCZ. Four machine-learning algorithms using sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory, vital signs, symptoms, and treatment features were applied to predict this outcome. Explainable methodologies, specifically SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Break Down, were employed to analyze the contribution of each individual feature. <b>Results:</b> Among 12,182 individuals, 344 (2.82%) and 64 (0.53%) received a subsequent diagnosis of BD and SCZ, respectively. Higher risk factors for BD progression included being female, having severe depression, being prescribed mood stabilizers, <i>\u03b2</i> receptor blockers (e.g., metoprolol tartrate and propranolol hydrochloride), and antipsychotics (e.g., sulpiride and quetiapine). Higher risk factors for SCZ progression included being male, exhibiting psychotic symptoms, being prescribed antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone and sulpiride), antiside effects drugs (e.g., trihexyphenidyl and hemp seed pill), and undergoing psychotherapy. Individuals with a family history of mental illness were particularly susceptible to conversion to BD and SCZ. <b>Conclusions:</b> The model's performance on the test dataset declined over time, with area under the curve (AUC) values for predicting BD conversion decreasing from 0.771 in 1 year to 0.749 in 2 years and 0.733 in 7 years, and for SCZ conversion, from 0.866 in 1 year to 0.829 in 3 years and 0.752 in 7 years. A key finding is that individuals with refractory (particularly psychotic) UD had an elevated risk of transitioning to BD and SCZ, with social-demographic factors, lifestyle behaviors, vital signs, and blood markers becoming significant risk factors over follow-up.

This, in turn, can improve outcomes for birthing parents experiencing psychological distress. We undertook group-based multi-trajectory modeling (GBMTM) to uncover the patterns of affective disorders (anger, anxiety, and depression) over three-time points (pregnancy, 3-, and 12-months postpartum (mPP)) in a large longitudinal cohort of persons who gave birth during the COVID-19 pandemic (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20092145).

Decreased mechanical loading and locomotion following the onset of paralysis in stroke patients, especially those who are non-ambulatory, contributes greatly to bone loss. Sclerostin, a protein encoded by the SOST gene, accumulates as a result of reduced mechanical loading and inhibits bone formation. This study explores the relationship between mechanical unloading, sclerostin levels, and bone mineral density (BMD) in stroke patients, utilizing three cohorts. Analysis of Cohort 1, consisting of patients with available sclerostin level measurements, found significantly elevated sclerostin levels in non-ambulatory patients compared to ambulatory patients, indicating the influence of ambulatory status on sclerostin regulation. Cohort 2, consisting of patients with BMD measurements, demonstrated that prolonged mechanical unloading in non-ambulatory patients resulted in a greater decline in BMD over time. Analysis in Cohort 3 patients, who had bilateral BMD measurements available, revealed that hemiplegic sides subjected to reduced mechanical loading exhibited lower BMD compared to non-hemiplegic sides. These findings collectively confirm the hypothesis that reduced mechanical loading elevates sclerostin levels and accelerates bone loss. By integrating data across the three cohorts, this study underscores the critical impact of mechanical unloading on bone health, particularly in chronic stroke patients with limited mobility. Our study provides clinical insights for treatments integrating ambulatory status, sclerostin levels, and BMD in chronic stroke patients and highlights an increased need for therapeutics targeting mechanical loading pathways and sclerostin accumulation which can be administered to treat chronic osteoporosis following stroke.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "02", "day": "11"}}, {"article_title": "Economic Impact of Elranatamab for Treatment of Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma.", "article_abstract": "To estimate the budget impact of adding elranatamab to the US formulary to treat adults with RRMM who have received \u22654 prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and to assess the total cost of care and cost per month of progression-free survival (PFS) between elranatamab and available treatments.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "08"}}, {"article_title": "Patterns of Factors in the National Institute on Aging Health Disparities Research Framework Domains and Mild Cognitive Impairment Risk.", "article_abstract": "Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are public health and social care challenges.

Being in the informal sector\u00a0can also pose foodborne illness risks due to\u00a0limited access to clean water, sanitary facilities, and food safety knowledge. A cross-sectional study can identify the prevalence of unsafe practices and provide a snapshot of the current state of food safety and hygiene practices among street vendors. To prevent such outbreaks, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) established standards for street food vendors under the Food Safety and Standards Act 2006. Method This cross-sectional study aims to assess the conformance of street food vendors with the BIS requirements for food safety and various factors affecting the same, assuming that 50% of street food vendors would conform to the requirements. The\u00a0prevalence was assumed to be 50% as no study was available for reference for conformance with the BIS requirements. With a precision of 10% on either side of the truth\u00a0and with 95% confidence to estimate the proportion of street vendors conforming with the BIS requirements, a sample size of 97 was calculated. The street food vendors operational in the area\u00a0were listed\u00a0in an urban slum of Pune in Maharashtra, and 100 among them were selected through a computer-generated random number table. A questionnaire based on the BIS was developed, with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 114. The investigator interviewed each vendor for 45-60 minutes using a structured questionnaire.\u00a0The questionnaire was validated by conducting a pilot study in the same area with a sample size of 20 vendors.\u00a0 Results The vendors' scores were evaluated against various demographic variables, including age, experience, education, place of residence, and monthly income. The data collected was analyzed for descriptives, and categorical data was analyzed using Chi-square and Fisher's exact statistical tests using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20 (Released 2011; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States).\u00a0The mean age of the vendors was 30.5 \u00b1 8.06 years, with an average experience of 4.87 \u00b1 2.93 years. The average monthly income of the vendors was Rs 6004 \u00b1 3179, and the majority of vendors were males (95%). Of the vendors, 64% scored satisfactory, with an overall score of \u226550%. The vendors' mean score was 60.2 \u00b1 13.9.

Results Forty-three patients\u00a0were divided\u00a0into two groups: 15 (34%) with delirium in the ICU and 28 (66%) without delirium. The association of delirium with different sequelae\u00a0was evaluated\u00a0using the corresponding scales: Pfeiffer scale: Cognitive impairment was observed in 7/13 patients (53%) in the delirium group vs. 0/29 patients (0%) in the non-delirious group (p 0.001); MMSE score:\u00a0Deterioration was observed in 6/7 patients (86%) in the delirium group vs. 1/7 patients (14%) in the non-delirious group (p 0.007).

Barthel scale: Dependence on others for ADLs was observed in 3/15 patients (20%) in the delirium group vs. 4/29 patients (14%) in the non-delirious group (p = 0.23). Conclusions Cognitive impairment\u00a0was observed\u00a0to be associated with delirium in the ICU, opening new avenues for research and possible treatment options. Although dependence on activities of daily living (ADLs) was more common in the delirium group, the difference between the two groups was\u00a0not significant, highlighting the need for further research to understand the whole picture. Rates of anxiety and depression after ICU stay were also similar between the two groups, providing a baseline for comparison and informing future studies.

LHON is caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations, most commonly m.11778G>A, m.14484T>C, and m.3460G>A. LHON has incomplete penetrance, with a higher prevalence in men, and its diagnosis is often delayed because of clinical overlap with other optic nerve disorders, such as optic neuritis. Herein, we report the case of a 37-year-old man presenting with progressive vision loss in both eyes over two months. Early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were suggestive of optic neuritis or peripapillary optic neuritis. Based on the MRI findings, the differential diagnoses for the patient's condition included multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-related diseases, sarcoidosis, Beh\u00e7et's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, and idiopathic optic neuritis and peripapillary optic neuritis. The patient was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and plasmapheresis. Despite immunotherapy, the patient's symptoms worsened. Comprehensive evaluation revealed normal cerebrospinal fluid and negative autoimmune markers. Mitochondrial DNA testing confirmed the m.11778G>A mutation, which led to the diagnosis of LHON.

His vision stabilized at 0.3 in the right eye, whereas the left eye became completely blind. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of LHON, particularly when MRI findings mimic optic neuritis. The preservation of the pupillary light reflex and nonresponse to immunotherapy are key diagnostic clues.

Despite ongoing management, she was discharged to hospice care. DRPE is a diagnostic challenge due to its delayed onset, sometimes appearing decades after RT. It can present with variable pleural fluid characteristics. Radiation-induced lung injury is a known complication of thoracic RT, with risk factors including radiation dose and pre-existing pulmonary conditions. Management is symptomatic, with treatments such as NSAIDs, corticosteroids, diuretics, and pleural drainage, though outcomes vary. In this case, pleural catheter placement offered temporary relief, but recurrent effusions led to hospice care. This case highlights the need for long-term monitoring in survivors of chest RT, as delayed pulmonary and cardiovascular toxicities can arise decades later.

In the skin, there are both internal and external drivers of oxidative stress that result in aging phenotypes. Oxidative stress has been used to model senescence <i>in vitro</i>; however, there has been a lack of research determining whether the severity of oxidative stress correlates with senescent phenotypes. <b>Methods:</b> In this work, we compare cellular and secretory responses to a single (500 \u03bcM hydrogen peroxide, 2 hours) or recurring dose of hydrogen peroxide (500 \u03bcM hydrogen peroxide, 2 hours + 4 \u00d7 300 \u03bcM hydrogen peroxide each 48 hours). Senescence induction was studied using markers including cell morphology, senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase, absence of apoptosis, and cell cycle inhibition genes. Next, functional studies of the effects of the signaling of these cells were completed, such as vascular potential, keratinocyte proliferation, and macrophage polarization. <b>Results:</b> Fibroblasts exposed to both single and recurring oxidative stress had increased total cell and nucleic area, increased senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase (SABGAL) expression, and they were able to escape apoptosis - all characteristics of senescent cells. Additionally, cells exposed to recurring oxidative stress expressed increased levels of cell cycle inhibitor genes and decreased expression of collagen-I, -III, and -IV. Cytokine profiling showed that the single stressed cells had a more inflammatory secretory profile. However, in functional assays, the recurring stressed cells had reduced vascular potential, reduced keratinocyte proliferation, and increased IL-1\u03b2 gene expression in unpolarized and polarized macrophages. <b>Discussion:</b> The described protocol allows for the investigation of the direct effects of single and recurring oxidative stress in fibroblasts and their secretory effects on surrounding healthy cells.

Understanding landrace propagation, selection, and in situ conservation practices is crucial. These practices are essential for crop improvement, management, conservation, and enhancement of genetic resources. This study investigates the utilization and in situ conservation practices of enset landraces and draws insights from farmers and agricultural experts through in-depth interviews, surveys, group discussions, and field observations. Representatives from the enset-growing areas of Hadiya, Gedeo, Gurage, and Kembata Tembaro zones and Basketo Special Woreda were selected due to their diverse sociocultural practices, geographic landscapes and distribution, altitude variations, enset farming systems, and rainfall patterns. Purposive sampling was employed to select 19 representatives from woredas based on traditional enset culture practices. Subsequently, 31 kebeles were chosen based on their altitude differences. A total of 406 household units were then selected. The relative density determined the abundance of individual landraces.

On the other hand, it has been described that one of the pathways that participates in the expression of utrophin in muscle is the Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1)/ErbB receptors pathway. Several studies have postulated that disintegrin and metalloprotease-17 (ADAM17) causes the proteolytic processing of NRG of transmembrane, allowing the release of NRG to the medium, which when joining its ErbB receptor activates the signaling pathway that triggers utrophin transcription. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of L-arginine in the activation of NRG-1/ErbB pathway and utrophin mRNA levels in C2C12\u2009cells, and the participation of ADAM17 in this process.

The ability of many Trichoderma species to both colonize the rhizosphere and parasitize plant pathogenic fungi has led to their use in biological pathogen control for several decades. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are linked to both the antagonism imposed by the mycoparasite Trichoderma and the elicited defence reaction by its fungal hosts during the mycoparasitic interaction. Trichoderma spp. likely tolerate higher levels of ROS compared with some of their host species, thereby giving them an advantage during the mycoparasitic interaction. In the present study, we investigated glutathione redox dynamics using the fluorescent reporter Grx1-roGFP2 stably expressed in Trichoderma asperellum following electrotransformation. Grx1-roGFP2 undergoes reversible changes in its excitation spectrum in response to variations in the cellular glutathione redox potential, providing a real-time indication of intracellular oxidative load. Considering the putative importance of ROS in mycoparasitic interactions, we performed live-cell imaging of the T. asperellum reporter strain interacting with the cereal pathogen Fusarium graminearum. Surprisingly, the glutathione redox potential did not change during this mycoparasitic interaction. We found no evidence that host-induced tip growth arrest within T. asperellum hyphae is induced by intracellular ROS accumulation. Furthermore, we show that the F. graminearum mycotoxins deoxynivalenol and zearalenone do not induce detectable changes in glutathione redox potential, even at very high concentrations. We infer that T. asperellum has a robust anti-oxidant defence system, supported by the observation that high concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are required to fully oxidize the reporter during in vivo calibration.

However, training the model required catch data for annotation, the amount of which was limited. To address this, we proposed a training strategy that combines weak supervision and meta-learning to estimate fishing grounds. Weak supervision involves using partially annotated or noisy data, where the labels are incomplete or imprecise. In our case, catch data cover only a subset of fishing grounds, and trajectory data, which are readily available and larger in volume than catch data, provide imprecise representations of fishing grounds. Meta-learning helps the model adapt to the noise by refining its learning rate during training. Our approach involved pre-training with trajectory data and fine-tuning with catch data, with a meta-learner further mitigating label noise during pre-training. Experimental results showed that our method improved the F1-score by 64% compared to the baseline using only catch data, demonstrating the effectiveness of pre-training and meta-learning.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "11"}}, {"article_title": "Cassiopea xamachana microbiome across anatomy, development, and geography.", "article_abstract": "The upside-down jellyfish holobiont, Cassiopea xamachana, is a useful model system for tri-partite interactions between the cnidarian host, the photosymbiont, and the bacterial microbiome. While the interaction between the host and photosymbiont has been well studied, less is understood of the associated bacterial community. To date, the bacterial microbiome of wild C. xamachana has remained largely uncharacterized. Thus, wild medusae (n=6) and larvae (n=3) were collected from two sites in the Florida Keys. Bacterial community composition was characterized via amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V4 region. The medusa bacterial community was dominated by members of the Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, while Planctomycetota, Actinomycetota, Bacteroidota, and Bacillota were also present, among others. Community composition was consistent between locations and across medusa structures (oral arm, bell, and gonad). The larval bacterial community clustered apart from the medusa community in beta diversity analysis and was characterized by the presence of several Pseudomonadota taxa that were not present in the medusa, including the Alteromonas, Pseudoalteromonas, and Thalassobius genera. A bacterial isolate library encompassing much of the amplicon sequencing diversity was also developed and tested via metabolic assays in a separate culture-dependent analysis of isolates from medusa bells, oral arms, and laplets. Most characteristics were not correlated with host sex or medusa structure, but gelatinase production was more common in laplet isolates, while lactose fermentation was more common in female oral arm isolates. The Endozoicomonas genus was dominant in both amplicon sequencing and in our isolate library, and was equally prevalent across all medusa structures and in both sexes.

Naively lumping data from pre- and post-design changes to estimate the size of the treatment effect, as planned in the original study, can introduce systematic bias and limit interpretability of the trial findings. There has been limited discussion on how to estimate the treatment effect when an RCT undergoes major design changes during the trial. Using our recently completed RCT, which underwent multiple design changes, as an example, we examined the statistical implications of design changes on the treatment effect estimates.MethodsOur example RCT aimed to test an advance care planning intervention targeting dementia patients and their surrogate decision-makers compared to usual care. The original trial underwent two major mid-trial design changes resulting in three smaller studies. The changes included altering the number of study arms and adding new recruitment sites, thus perturbing the initial statistical assumptions. We used a simulation study to mimic these design modifications in our RCT, generate independent patient-level data and evaluate na\u00efve lumping of data, a two-stage fixed-effect and random-effect meta-analysis model to obtain an average effect size estimate from all studies. Standardized mean-difference and odds-ratio estimates at post-intervention were used as effect sizes for continuous and binary outcomes, respectively. The performance of the estimates from different methods were compared by studying their statistical properties (e.g. bias, mean squared error, and coverage probability of 95% confidence intervals).ResultsWhen between-design heterogeneity is negligible, the fixed- and random-effect meta-analysis models yielded accurate and precise effect-size estimates for both continuous and binary data. As between-design heterogeneity increased, the estimates from random meta-analysis methods indicated less bias and higher coverage probability compared to the na\u00efve and fixed-effect methods, however the mean squared error was higher indicating greater uncertainty arising from a small number of studies. The between-study heterogeneity parameter was not precisely estimable due to fewer studies. With increasing sample sizes within each study, the effect-size estimates showed improved precision and statistical power.ConclusionsWhen a trial undergoes unplanned major design changes, the statistical approach to estimate the treatment effect needs to be determined carefully. Na\u00efve lumping of data across designs is not appropriate even when the overall goal of the trial remains unchanged. Understanding the implications of the different aspects of design changes and accounting for them in the analysis of the data are essential for internal validity and reporting of the trial findings.

GAN is essentially a two-player zero-sum game between the generator and the discriminator. The same concept can be applied to AT with attacker and classifier as players. Training these models is challenging as a pure Nash equilibrium may not exist and even finding the mixed Nash equilibrium is difficult as training algorithms for both GAN and AT have a large-scale strategy space. Extending our preliminary model DO-GAN, we propose the methods to apply the double oracle framework concept to Adversarial Neural Architecture Search (NAS for GAN) and Adversarial Training (NAS for AT) algorithms. We first generalize the players' strategies as the trained models of generator and discriminator from the best response oracles. We then compute the meta-strategies using a linear program. For scalability of the framework where multiple network models of best responses are stored in the memory, we prune the weakly-dominated players' strategies to keep the oracles from becoming intractable. Finally, we conduct experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and TinyImageNet for DONAS-GAN. We also evaluate the robustness under FGSM and PGD attacks on CIFAR-10, SVHN and TinyImageNet for DONAS-AT.

The combination of biomaterials and stem cell-derived exosomes is a promising wound treatment strategy with significant clinical value. <b>Methods:</b> We isolate primary nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) and primary annulus fibrosus cells (AFCs) from rats as the target cells of rat insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF1), and verify the proliferation and migration; constructed cartilage endplate stem cells (CESCs) engineered cells that release exosomes containing high concentrations of IGF1by lentiviral infection, and used the IGF1-CESCs combined with combined silk fibroin (SF) and a collagen-mixed hydrogel for the treatment of AF wounds in rat. <b>Results:</b> We found that both IGF1 and IGF1-rich exosomes (IGF1 Exo) promoted the proliferation and migration of AFCs. SF and collagen mixed hydrogels have excellent compressive mechanical properties and are suitable for use in IVD therapy. After the IGF1-CESCs@SF-collagen hydrogel was filled in the damaged area of the AF in rat, the wound healing was accelerated, nucleus pulposus overflow was inhibited, the IVD height was maintained, and degeneration was reduced. <b>Discussion:</b> The IGF1-CESCs@SF-collagen hydrogel can efficiently treat AF wounds and inhibit degeneration of IVD, and has potential for clinical treatment.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "03", "day": "27"}}, {"article_title": "Therapeutic potential of FAPI RLT in oncology: A systematic review.", "article_abstract": "<b>Rationale:</b> This systematic review aims to examine the safety and efficacy of fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI) radioligand therapy (RLT) for various epithelial neoplasms. <b>Methods:</b> PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched up to Jan 4, 2025, for studies involving FAPI RLT in various cancers.

Intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid (HA) derivatives, also known as viscosupplementation (VS), is a common treatment for the symptomatic management of knee OA. Despite its widespread use, the magnitude of the clinical benefit of VS remains controversial, with conflicting results due to methodological differences and possible differences in efficacy between products related to remanence and rheological properties. <b>Methods:</b> Here, to create an effective HA-based treatment, an injectable self-healing HA hydrogel with long-persistent radiopacity is formed by tethering a clinical iodine contrast agent to HA. The labeling conditions are tuned to obtain sufficient X-ray signal without altering the biocompatibility, rheological and injectability properties of the hydrogel. <b>Results:</b> The iodine labeling enabled to monitor not only delivery of the hydrogel but also its retention in mouse knees up to 5 weeks post-administration using synchrotron K-edge subtraction-computed tomography. We further demonstrated that the unique properties of this hydrogel enable creation of a transient HA network <i>in vivo</i> that attenuates OA progression in a mouse model of OA. Moreover, our data showed that the rate of HA-I disappearance appears to predict treatment response, likely because a rapid elimination serves as an indirect indicator of <i>in situ</i> inflammation. <b>Conclusion:</b> Collectively, these results show that our radiopaque HA-I hydrogel holds significant promise for improving patient management in the treatment of OA before clinical symptoms worsen.

The circuitry and molecular mechanisms for depression comorbid with chronic pain are thus far unclear. We characterized the projection from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and assessed the functional significance of the pathway in chronic pain-induced depressive comorbidity. <b>Methods:</b> A neuropathic cuff model was adopted and discriminated against the susceptible and resilient groups with or without depression-like behaviors, respectively. The anatomical feature and function of the VTA-vHPC pathway were assessed by tracer and virus-based tracing, immunofluorescent staining, fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH), designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), optogenetics, and <i>ex vivo</i> electrophysiology. <b>Results:</b> A group of medially-located dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons displayed few overlappings with the medial prefrontal cortex- or nucleus accumbens-projecting neurons, constituting the major projection from the VTA to the vHPC. The activity of vHPC-projecting DAergic neurons was downregulated in the susceptible group but not in the resilient group, as manifested by the decreased expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), TH/FOS double-labeling, and excitability in retrogradely labeled VTA neurons. Chemogenetic activation of the pathway significantly improved depression rather than pain phenotype, but caspase 3-based ablation induced depression. Optogenetic activation of the VTA<sup>DA</sup>-vHPC pathway produced similar anti-depressant effects in cuff animals in an equally D1 or D2 receptor-dependent manner. FISH and Western blotting disclosed a low-segregated expression of the D1 receptor in the pyramidal neurons and a highly-segregated expression of the D2 receptor in GABAergic neurons in vHPC, which underwent no change or upregulation following cuffing. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results demonstrate a medially dominant VTA<sup>DA</sup> projection to the vHPC.

However, IDO will convert tryptophan (Trp) into kynurenine (Kyn), which can inhibit Trp-sensitive T cells functional activity and induce immunosuppressive effects. The efficient nanomedicines for combination of STING agonist and IDO inhibitor have been rarely explored. <b>Methods:</b> A diblock polymer polyprodrug was synthesized with the IDO inhibitor 1-methyl-tryptophan (1-MT) linked by thioketal bonds and the photosensitizer 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) in the hydrophobic block as well as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) targeting group (4-methylphenyl) sulfonamide in the hydrophilic block. After self-assembly in aqueous solution, the micelles loading STING agonist SR-717 (SR@ET-PMT) can be formed with a high loading efficiency. After cellular internalization, the micelles can target ER. Upon exposure to light irradiation of 650 nm, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be generated to break thioketal bonds and dissociate the micelles to release 1-MT and STING agonist. Accompanied by photodynamic therapy (PDT), STING activation and IDO inhibition are achieved simultaneously. <b>Results:</b> <i>In vitro</i> observation reveals the PDT effect, ER targeting, and photoactivated drug release. <i>In vivo</i> animal model results demonstrate that the photoactivatable immunomodulator polyprodrug micelles show excellent tumor accumulation and potent immune activation capability to inhibit solid tumors.

Current interventions often fail due to the complexities of tumour progression and drug resistance driven by frequent intravitreal injection and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Consequently, there is an unmet need for more effective, less invasive treatments. <b>Methods:</b> A near-infrared (NIR)-responsive liposome/hydrogel platform that incorporates quercetin (QUE) and doxorubicin (DOX) co-loaded liposomes (QD Lipo), and indocyanine green (ICG) in a low-gelling temperature agarose hydrogel (LAgel) was developed to improve efficacy through localized, on-demand delivery of chemo-photothermal therapy directly at the site of tumour.

While monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) leveraging natural killer (NK) cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity show great potential, none have gained clinical approval for AML. Immunocytokines have emerged as a promising strategy to overcome the limited efficacy of therapeutic antibodies. IL-15 stimulates activation, proliferation cytotoxic activity of NK cells, but its clinical use is prevented by short half-life, poor accumulation in the tumor, and toxicity due to systemic off-target immune activation. Here we report on the generation and preclinical characterization of modified immunocytokines consisting of an Fc-optimized CLEC12A (CLL-1) antibody fused to an IL-15 moiety with E46K mutation. The mutation abrogates binding to IL-15R\u03b1, thereby enabling substitution of physiological trans-presentation by target binding and thus conditional IL-15R\u03b2/\u03b3 stimulation to reduce systemic toxicity. An optimal CLEC12A binder was selected from a range of murine mAbs, based on analysis of AML cell lines and leukemic cells from patients. This antibody was then used to construct an immunocytokine (MIC12) that subsequently was characterized functionally. Analysis of NK cell activation, cytokine release, proliferation and anti-leukemia reactivity demonstrated that MIC12 induced superior target cell killing and NK cell expansion compared to Fc-optimized CLEC12A antibody, with efficacy being dependent on target antigen binding.

Ticks of the genus Ixodidae are globally abundant and transmit a wide variety of pathogens that cause human infections, including tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme borreliosis. The transmission of pathogens into human skin while blood feeding causes changes in the local immune cell network and has various effects on structural skin cells, including sensory neurons. Recent studies have focused on the effect of tick saliva on cells at the cutaneous tick-host interface and have suggested a strong immunomodulatory function. Within seconds after a tick bite, saliva containing various bioactive molecules is secreted into the host's skin, leading to vasodilation, inhibition of coagulation and anti-inflammatory actions. Inhibition of immune cell recruitment and cytokine secretion, facilitate prolonged tick attachment and blood feeding as well as pathogen transmission. Therefore, in recent years, efforts have intensified to identify tick salivary compounds by multi-omics approaches and investigate their individual effects on innate and adaptive immunological mechanisms. In this review, we summarize important features of tick saliva molecules and how they influence and modulate skin cell behavior on the tick-host interface to facilitate tick attachment and pathogen transmission.

While both models are designed for medical image segmentation, STU-Net introduces critical improvements in scalability and transferability, with parameter sizes ranging from 14 million to 1.4 billion. Leveraging large-scale pre-training on datasets such as TotalSegmentator, STU-Net captures complex and variable tumor structures more effectively.

To this end, we fabricated round and ring-shaped silk fibroin/<i>Broussonetia kazinoki</i> (SFBK) composite scaffolds. The round scaffolds had a diameter of 1.5 mm, and the ring-shaped scaffolds had a 6-mm diameter with a 1.5-mm hole in the center. All scaffolds had a 3-mm thickness. A portion of round SFBKs was cross-linked with stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), and ring-shaped scaffolds underwent in\u00a0vitro angiogenic stimulation, in\u00a0vivo vascularization, or both. These scaffolds were assembled by fitting a round SFBK into the center of a vascularized SFBK scaffold before implantation into a rat model with critical-sized calvarial defects. Implantation with puzzle-fitted scaffolds promoted bone regeneration, and the scaffold that underwent both SDF-1 immobilization and vascularization processes showed the greatest efficacy in the healing of defects. The bone healing efficacy of puzzle-fitted scaffolds involved their ability to stimulate microvascular network formation, collagen synthesis, and stem cell recruitment at defects. <i>B. kazinoki</i>-released calcium ions also participated in synergistic bone regeneration. These results suggest that the strategy of fitting SDF-1-linked SFBK into a vascularized ring-SFBK scaffold is useful in recruiting multipotent stem cells via newly formed blood vessels toward the center of scaffolds. This induces balanced and uniform bone regeneration. Overall, this study highlights the needs of calcium release, neovascularization, and stem cell recruitment for synergistic enhancement of bone regeneration.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "10"}}, {"article_title": "Determinants of post-penitentiary social reintegration: analysis of the needs and perceptions of persons released from detention in Romania.", "article_abstract": "The social reintegration of people released from prison represents a significant challenge in Romania, being influenced by factors such as discrimination, social marginalization, and economic difficulties.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "03", "day": "27"}}, {"article_title": "Etiology and clinical features of Han Chinese patients with Duane retraction syndrome.", "article_abstract": "Duane retraction syndrome (DRS) is a congenital ocular motility disorder. The aim of this study was to retrospectively describe the etiology, clinical findings, imaging characteristics, and surgical outcomes of 42 Han Chinese patients with DRS. All patients underwent detailed clinical evaluation. Next-generation sequencing was performed to identify pathogenic variants in the disease-causing genes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography were used to evaluate the patient's cranial nerves. Surgical procedures were designed individually to correct strabismus, abnormal facial turns, and overshooting. A total of 17 patients were diagnosed with DRS1, 4 with DRS2 and 21 with DRS3. Genetic testing revealed that two novel pathogenic variants of c.377T>C (p. Ile126Thr) and c.659A>G (p. Glu220Gly) in the <i>CHN1</i> gene and a <i>de novo</i> pathogenic variant of c.1432-2A>T in the <i>SALL4</i> gene were detected in patients with DRS1. In 12 of the 14 patients with DRS1 and 9 of the 17 patients with DRS3, the abducens nerve was found to be absent in the MRI images, and in 4 of the patients with DRS2, the abducens nerve was detected as hypoplasia. In addition, the projective fibers from the abducens neurons to the contralateral ocular motor neurons via the medial longitudinal fasciculus were also absent in those patients without abducens nerve in DTI images. Thirty-five patients who underwent strabismus surgery gained binocular vision and an improved appearance. In summary, our genetic findings contribute to expanding the spectrum of variants in the <i>CHN1</i> and <i>SALL4</i> genes. Molecular etiology and imaging studies support that cranial maldevelopment is a major cause of DRS.

The synergistic effect between the incorporation of anion-trapping boron moiety and in\u2009situ polymerization rendered the QSPEs exhibiting higher electrochemical voltage window, ionic conductivity, and transference number as well as better electrochemical performance than the PEG-based counterpart.

Although deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) reduces the heart dose, it is underutilized. The selection of proper candidates for DIBH remains an unresolved issue. This study compared dosimetric parameters between free breathing (FB) and DIBH, monitored myocardial enzymes, and aimed to identify factors that can predict cardiac injury thus developing a method to identify proper patients for DIBH.MethodsThis is a prospective cohort study, enrolling 58 patients with left-sided breast cancer following breast-conserving surgery. All patients underwent computed tomography scans in both FB and DIBH states. A comparative analysis of dosimetric features between DIBH and FB was conducted. Myocardial enzyme was monitored until six months post-radiation therapy. T-tests were used to assess differences between the DIBH and the FB. Pearson correlation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with the subclinical acute cardiac injury.ResultsThe mean heart dose (MHD) of the DIBH group significantly dropped as compared to the FB group (3.81 Gy vs 1.65 Gy p\u2009=\u20090.001). Cardiac V40, V30, V25, V10, and V5 volumes also significantly reduced. 9(15.51%) patients exhibited increased myocardial enzyme, with cTnI being the most sensitive indicator. The heart dose was a predictor for the cardiac enzyme's elevation. The ROC curve analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.6. With an MHD threshold of 2 Gy, both sensitivity and specificity exceeded 0.7.ConclusionDIBH significantly diminishes radiation exposure to the heart and LAD compared with FB. Cardiac enzyme analysis facilitates the early detection of cardiac injury following radiation therapy.

Both experiments used green romaine lettuce and a customized indoor growth system with light emitting diode (LED) lights. We measured fresh weight (FW), dry weight, leaf area, leaf number, and Phyllo levels in both experiments. Photosynthesis (A)- photon flux density (PPFD) response curves were measured in the second experiment. In the first experiment, plants were grown under six monochromatic light treatments viz., ultraviolet (UV389), blue (B450), green (G521), red (R632), hyper-red (R662), and far-red (FR733) during the entire growth period.

Results indicated that FW was lower by 24% but Phyllo level increased by approximately 175% in the UVsub treatment compared to control. These results suggest that UV389 provided during the stationary growth phase can enhance Phyllo, however, further lowering the percentage of UV389 may be required to minimize the negative effect on vegetative growth. Analysis of A-PPFD curves indicated lower operating photosynthesis (AOP) and light use efficiency (LUE) in the UVsub compared to control.

Although the conduct of 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies has been the standard approach for evaluating the carcinogenic potential of chemicals and new drugs for approximately 6 decades, there are multiple examples showing that such studies are not predictive of human cancer risk. Given these concerns with 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies, we have developed and applied an alternative approach for supplementing existing data related to carcinogenic potential for six of the most commonly used UV filters in sunscreen products (i.e. avobenzone, ensulizole, homosalate, octinoxate, octisalate, and octocrylene). This approach evaluates their mode of action (MOA) based on <i>in\u00a0vivo</i>, <i>in\u00a0vitro</i>, and <i>in silico</i> data combined with an assessment of exposure margins. This approach is based on the substantial progress in understanding the MOAs that are responsible for tumor induction in humans. It is consistent with those being developed by the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) and other health authorities to replace 2-year carcinogenicity studies given their limitations and questionable biological relevance to humans. The available data for the six UV filters show that they are not genotoxic and show no evidence of biologically relevant carcinogenic MOAs. Furthermore, their systemic exposure levels in humans fall well below concentrations at which they have biologic activity. In conclusion, these data support the continued safe use of these six filters in sunscreen products.", "pub_date": {"year": "2025", "month": "04", "day": "10"}}]
